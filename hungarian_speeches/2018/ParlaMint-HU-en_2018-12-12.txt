u2018-12-12-4	Dear House, First of all, I would like to thank Vice-President János Latorcai with great respect and respect. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]] to ensure the fulfilment of the constitutional obligations of the Hungarian Parliament in order to prevent an unprecedented attempt to obstruct the past 28 years of Hungarian democracy. Congratulations on making only two mistakes in this, plus once, what we've just noticed. To this end, I would like to inform you that T/3353 on administrative courts. In deciding on bill No 20, instead of maintaining Amendment No 20, we mistakenly decided on Amendment No 23. Therefore, in order to avoid any subsequent debate, we must now also decide to maintain Amendment 20. I therefore ask the Honourable Parliament and ask for the vote on the machine, thank you very much for maintaining Amendment 20. Before the clock is started, everyone should look in their starbus for what we are voting on and what the decision is to make sure that this is not a misunderstanding, because this is not the European Parliament, that we will repeat our decision afterwards. [[György Balla interrupts: I've found him! Defiance.]] Thank you very much. So I ask the Honourable Parliament to maintain Amendment 20. Please vote. [[Vote.]] The House therefore unanimously rejected the continuation of Amendment 20 by 128 votes to none. Here's some clarification. I declare that T/3371 on the amendment of Act I of 2004 on Sport. At the end of the vote on bill No.3 we adopted, during the second vote, the parts of the amended bill requiring a simple majority for the sake of the minutes. I would also like to announce that the 2006 LIII on speeding up and simplifying the implementation of investments that are of major national importance. T/3629. During the final vote on the legislative proposal No.3 the Parliament's decision was not announced: the bill was adopted by the Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, We are waiting for Mr President of the Republic, and then we will take the oath, the elected national electoral committee member and the alternates will take the oath. [[It's a short break. Dr. János Áder enters the Presidential box.]] President of the Republic is coming. Please stand up. [[The people in this room stand up.]] Thank you. [[The people in this room will take their seats.]] Dear House, Now it's time for the solemn oath. I call on the elected member and alternate members of the National Election Committee to come to the centre of the Chamber and take the oath. I ask Mr. István Tiba to read the text of the oath, and I ask the Honourable Parliament to stand up under the words of the oath. [[The people in this room stand up. Dr. Tamás Károly Szalay, Dr. András Téglási, Dr. László Firicz and Dr. Mária Bordás step into the center of the room. Dr. István Tiba reads the words of the oath.]]

So help me God.
u2018-12-12-6	Dear Parliament, I would ask Mr Attila Móring to prepare the oath papers for signature and invite the member and alternate members of the National Election Committee to sign them. [[It's happening. Attila Móring József, who signed the oath document, congratulates Dr. Tamás Károly Szalay, Dr. András Téglási, Dr. László Firicz and Dr. Mária Bordás, and gives a copy of the signed oath document. Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, then Máté Kocsis, Dr Zsolt Semjén, Péter Harrach and Gergely Gulyás congratulate the elected member and his alternates. After the congratulations, they will leave the Chamber under the leadership of a staff member of the Office-proofing Service.]] At the same time allow me to wish the member and alternate members of the National Election Committee, on behalf of Parliament and myself, effective work and good luck. I invite Vice-President Sándor Lezsák to continue the session. [[Break: 2 p.m.]]
u2018-12-12-7	Dear Parliament, We'll get back to work. I would like to inform you that the declarations, information materials and the envelope relating to the family member's declaration of property will be received by the representatives at the reception desk at the entrance of the Chamber, with the name of the minority advocates at the secretariat of the Committee of Nationalities in Hungary. Dear Parliament, Coming up next, the climate change of the 21st century. One of the biggest global and domestic challenges of the 20th century, the political debate on curbing and adapting to the expected impacts, initiated by Márta Demeter and his fellow Members. The motion to initiate the political debate V/3543. was given to them. Dear Parliament, I would ask Mr László Földi to explain the course of the political debate. Mr. Messenger!
u2018-12-12-8	Dear Parliament, First, a statement by the representative of the Government shall be made in a 40-minute period. The speakers of each political group will then speak in 15-15 minutes; then the first independent Member may speak. Further speeches are then possible within the remaining timeframe. Finally, the representative of the Government will respond in 20 minutes to what has been said in the debate.
u2018-12-12-9	Thank you very much. Dear Parliament, I would like to inform the Honourable Parliament that, since the notaries are not available in sufficient numbers at the meeting of the Parliament, in this case, the chairman of the meeting invites Mr.Lőrinc Nacsa to perform the duties of notary. Please go up to the pulpit. [[Lőrinc Nacsa takes the notary seat.]] Dear Parliament, Allow me to remind you of the more important rules of the time-frame debate. The speaking time of the member of the Government who spoke during the debate is expected to be in the time of the pro-government factions. In the meantime, two-minute speeches shall be included in the time frame, with the exception of responding to personal concerns. Point of order speeches are not included in the time frame. On the meeting room information board, interested parties can monitor the use of time frames. Dear Parliament, I would like to announce that the LMP Group has initiated a doubling of its time frame. Thus, the time frame is divided into 103 minutes for the Fidesz Group; 47 minutes for the KDNP Group; 40 minutes for the Jobbik Group, 32 minutes for the MSZP Group; 25 minutes for the DK Group; 44 minutes for the LMP Group; 21 minutes for the Dialogue Group; 10 minutes for the independent Members. [[14.10]] The time limits provided for the factions include the 15-15 minutes lead speakers. Dear Parliament, It is now the government's debate launcher, which is presented by three speakers within a total of 40 minutes' time frame. First, I give the floor to Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó. You have the floor, Minister.
u2018-12-12-10	Thank you for the floor. Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, It is now known to everyone that extreme weather conditions are becoming more direct, more diverse and increasingly challenging to human civilization. Today, the average temperature has risen by 0.12 degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era. As a result of extreme weather phenomena and warming, we are faced with a reduction in crops, loss of living resources and conflicts over resources. The consequences of these environmental crises and disasters require coordinated international action in order to respond to these challenges in a timely and effective manner. Security policy considerations must become a central element in climate change action. Ladies and gentlemen, The threats caused by climate change must not be taken lightly, as from the fight for resources and energy, through the instability of states, to the strengthening of radical ideas, we will face a number of consequences in the future. These changes, these climatic changes, can easily trigger further mass migration waves. According to data from the International Migration Organisation, 17,7 internally displaced persons were forced to leave their homes only until September 2018 for reasons related to environmental change. Moreover, overall, the number of migrants has increased significantly over the last 15 years. In 2000, according to IOM data, 173 million people were spoken of, and by 2015, 244 million people would be forced to leave their homes and 700 million people would be forced to leave their homes by 2050. Ladies and gentlemen, The UN estimates the number of migrants on the road due to desertification to 135 million by 2045, and drought already kills the most people in environmental disasters. Already today, more than one billion people do not have enough drinking water, and unfortunately, this number is expected to increase by 30 percent by 2030. Ladies and gentlemen, The recent migration movements that remain at regional level, which are triggered by climate change, can in future turn into long-term migration flows between continents, and the two most affected continents will, of course, be Africa and Asia. At the same time, people starting from Africa and Asia generally move towards Europe. Of course, we should not ignore these processes, because we have already had direct experience of what it is like to have large numbers of illegal migrants violate our borders, ignore our rules, our culture and the standards that we follow. Ladies and gentlemen, The risks of climate change have been recognised and recognised by the international community. At the last high-level meeting of the European Union, it was also found that the challenges posed by climate change should be seen as a national security risk, and the conclusions of the European Council on the subject stated that climate change has a direct and indirect impact on international security and stability, and that it contributes to mass population movements and migration in Hungarian. And the European Union has recommended to the UN Security Council that the links between climate change and security should become a recurring element in the deliberations preparing the UN Security Council resolutions and statements. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change also recognises the clear link between climate change and global security. Ladies and gentlemen, However, we must make it clear that persons leaving their homes for climatic reasons have not fled. Under the Geneva Convention, refugees are those who, because of their belonging to a national, racial, religious or specific social group, or who, as a result of their political convictions, are subject to persecution in their country or to an established risk. Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, I think that we should also see as valid the principle that, in relation to migration flows, we must not inspire migration, we must not persuade people to leave their homes as far as possible, but we must remove the root causes. The Paris Climate Convention, which was signed in 2016, confirmed this approach as it attaches the same importance to emission reductions and adaptation action. However, the negative effects of climate change are most affected by developing countries, which have limited capacity to adapt due to their economic background. Hungary will, of course, take part in the international struggle to address the consequences of migration from climate change, which has made Hungary's experience in the water industry, agriculture and renewable energy-based industries available to and from the international community. After all, in many areas in Africa and Asia either water scarcity or excessive and excessive water release at the same time is the biggest problem, and because Hungary is extremely competitive at international level in the field of water industry and water management, we make our knowledge, experience and technology of this industry available to the international community and to those countries that face these challenges most. The Hungarian agricultural sector is also strong, it has serious experience, which can also be used under the specific agricultural conditions of developing countries. Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, We believe that if we are able to succeed in improving the security and economic situation of the countries of origin and of developing countries, we will be able to significantly control migration flows, which, however, could pose a major threat to many parts of the world if we turn a blind eye to the challenges of climate change and do not deal with them in time. Once again, we have a fundamental principle here: the causes of migration, including the challenge of climate change, must be addressed. Thank you very much for your attention. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]]
u2018-12-12-11	Thank you, Minister Peter Szijjártó. I now give the floor to Mr Péter Kaderjak, State Secretary of the Ministry of Innovation and Technology. You have the floor, Mr. Secretary.
u2018-12-12-12	Thank you very much, Mr. President. Dear Parliament, Today's political debate is very topical, as action on climate protection has reached four levels. Following the Paris agreement adopted in 2015, events accelerated and, as a result, we have reached the stage of finalising and implementing programmes and plans which are both international, EU and domesticly challenging. During the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the latest meeting of the Parties is taking place just days in Katowice, Poland, where countries are conducting intensive negotiations to adopt the detailed rules of the Paris Agreement, namely the work programme for implementing the Paris Agreement. [[14.20]] The EU Presidency is also making great efforts at these moments to establish this work programme. The agreed Paris Agreement, which replaces the Kyoto Protocol with a system of commitments for developed countries only, provides an appropriate framework for the management of international climate policy after 2020 and thus for the implementation of EU climate protection measures. On 31 October, the Parliament adopted the second national climate change strategy for the period 2018-2030, which also provides an outlook for the period up to 2050. On the basis of the Parliamentary Decision on the Second National Climate Change Strategy, we will have to and will draw up an Action Plan on Climate Change within six months and every three years thereafter. Finally, our energy use is responsible for three quarters of our greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. It is therefore inevitable that our climate policy should focus on a climate-conscious energy policy. In parallel with the development of the climate action plan, we are working on the Government's decision to review the current national energy strategy and to finalise the integrated national energy and climate plan next year in line with our EU obligations. It therefore appears that at all levels, at international and domestic level, the time has come to finalise and act on climate plans for the coming decades. In order to promote the finalization and successful implementation of Hungarian ideas next year, I would like to ask for your effective assistance and cooperation in advance. Dear Parliament, At the beginning of today's debate, it is worth noting that according to the most recent evaluation reports, only six players are responsible for more than 70 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions from climate change, namely China, the United States of America, 28 Member States of the European Union, India, Russia and Japan. In particular, China and the United States alone account for more than 40 percent of world emissions. Hungary accounts for about 0.13 percent of world emissions and only about 1.2 percent of EU emissions. There is a legitimate question as to why, despite our relatively small contribution to the problem of climate change, this issue should be dealt with in particular here in the Hungarian Parliament, and action on climate change should also be a fundamental issue for our future at home. The answer is summarised in the following five points, which set out the basics of our climate change policy. Firstly, scientific analysis suggests that climate change is taking place faster than we thought, and its negative effects are particularly serious for our country. Therefore, in the area of climate protection, we believe that we should prevent the avoidance, but also prepare for the inevitable, that is to say, in addition to the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we must give priority to strengthening our capacity to adapt to climate change and to shaping our approach to this. Secondly, many people raise the opposite of economic growth and climate protection, implying that the latter is drawing resources from the economy unnecessarily. We're looking at it the other way. Climate change forces most countries around the world to act quickly, including in-depth transformation of energy supply, transport, water, forest and agriculture. It is a huge and growing market and business opportunity for all the economies and businesses that will offer the most competitive solutions to these needs. Hungary should belong to this group, because it has all the potential to do so, and therefore our economic growth, which is increasingly dependent on dynamic and qualitative innovation, can be a strong support for exploring and exploiting the innovation and business opportunities of climate-friendly restructuring of the economy. We call this a championship field. At the same time, economic development must be achieved in a sustainable manner in line with the climate protection requirement, and Hungary plans to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030, in full compliance with the European Union's commitment to maintain dynamic economic growth compared to the 1990 base. On the basis of the above, the focus of our emission reduction measures is on measures to support energy security and innovation, which offer other social benefits in addition to climate protection, with a particular focus on the sustainable reduction of overhead costs. Therefore, the backbone of government measures is to promote all forms of energy saving, including rationalising the use of energy in buildings, increasing renewable energy use, greening of transport and the use of nuclear energy. We consider it a realistic goal to increase the share of renewable energy sources in our energy use by 2030 from the current 14 percent to 20 percent. Measures to strengthen our capacity to adapt to the negative effects of climate change are aimed at those points where Hungary is most sensitive to climate change. These are the protection of our waters and agricultural land, the mitigation of the negative effects of climate change on human health and the enhancement of the resilience of critical infrastructure services to extreme climatic phenomena. Finally, we stress that, while the government has a high responsibility for protecting our climate, climate protection is the most basically our common concern: local governments, businesses, local religious and civil communities, environmental protection and nature conservation organisations, educational institutions, families and every single Hungarian citizen must take part in this joint issue. Only in the case of close cooperation do we have a chance of joint success in the area of climate protection. Dear Parliament, Let us now look at Hungary's situation. It is important that we are all aware of the current climate picture and outlook in Hungary, and allow me to inform you about the government's initiative to support scientific cooperation. In Hungary, the 1.15 degrees Celsius national temperature increase since the beginning of the last century exceeds the estimated global change of 0.9 degrees Celsius. The average temperature in Hungary will increase beyond any doubt in the future, until the middle of the century we can expect a change of 1.4-2,6 degrees in summer and 1.6-2 degrees in autumn, while by the end of the century growth may be close to autumn and may exceed 4 degrees in summer. In order to enable our country to adapt to the inevitable and avoid the avoidance, the Hungarian government plans to draw up a national report focusing on Hungary, based on the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on global climate change, the first occasion of which was retained in the Ministry of Innovation and Technology. Dear Parliament, The situation in Hungary is favourable for greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. Compared to 1990, domestic emissions decreased by 34 percent, and climate protection efforts played a prominent role in the decline in addition to economic activity. The emissions per capita of around 6 tonnes for Hungary are lower than the European average over 8 tonnes/person. Between 2008 and 2009, our emissions decreased by nearly 9 percent, then in the next five years, between 2009 and 13 they remained at not only low levels, but they showed a further 12 percent decrease. Although the downward trend in emissions was interrupted in 14 and we were already able to register a 5 per cent increase in 15 and, albeit to a lesser extent, growth continued in 2016, in recent years emissions have increased in close association with rising economic growth, thus as a result of growth. [[14.30]] At the same time, it is important to note that the misconception that there is necessarily a conflict between economic growth and decarbonisation has proved to be unfounded in Hungary; while GDP grew by 59 percent in Hungary between 1995 and 2016, greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 19 percent during the same period. A number of government measures have contributed to the development of a positive overall picture. The government promotes national electromobility and energy efficiency programmes from Member States' quota revenues through the popular programmes of the green investment system, the green economy financing system and the economic greening system; in sectors outside the emission trading sector such as transport, waste management, agriculture and built environments, Hungary is a high priority among the Member States of the European Union with its outstanding emission reduction results. Although it could have increased its emissions by 10% by 2020 based on its target, it is expected that it will be able to achieve at least the same reduction. Our country is currently at minus 13 per cent compared to the base year 2005 based on the inventory data available in 2016. The main contribution to reducing emissions was the change in the energy consumption of the building stock, where emissions fell by around 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent between 2005 and 2016. This is a greenhouse gas emission of an equivalent magnitude to the annual emissions of the Mátra Power Plant, corresponding to a 32 per cent reduction. Overall, household fuel consumption, which also depended on weather developments, decreased by around 11-13 percent during this period. Gas consumption decreased even more drastically by 42 percent between 2005 and 2014, while the use of firewood and other biomass doubled at the same time. These positive developments have been significantly contributed by grants for the energy modernisation of public institutions, which exceed a hundred billion forints, as well as programmes to support the building energy and equipment exchange of the "Hot Home" programme. Allow me to briefly summarise the major climate policy results achieved since 2010 following the presentation of emissions data, as climate regulation and implementation in Hungary have undergone a number of positive changes in recent years. The Parliament announced the Paris Agreement adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change by Act L of 2016. Hungary has been involved in international climate finance since 2010 and is a member of the Steering Committee of the Global Environment Facility, a UN environmental programme implementation unit. The Kigali amendment of the Montreal Protocol can facilitate the uptake of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient technologies, and Hungary is the first to conclude the internal ratification process in the European Union and in the world. Within the framework of the Environmental and Energy Efficiency Operational Programme, climate strategies have been developed in the county of 19 counties, as well as the climate strategy of Budapest, which serves as the basis for the necessary improvements at the level. In addition, a broad target group of county climate change platforms and a capital climate change platform have been established. Local, regional and national climate change strategies and decision-making, as well as the necessary measures, will be supported by the National Adaptation Space Information System, which was developed in 2012 with a legislative and conceptual basis, and the operational system will be available from 2016. In addition to the CCP, it was also possible to develop sustainable energy and climate action plans for rural development communities with urban and local development strategies in operational programmes for territorial and urban development. I would like to point out that on 12 September 2018, the Association of County-righted Cities bringing together 23 Hungarian rural cities joined the so-called Under2, or 2 degrees Celsius climate protection coalition. The members of the International Climate Protection Alliance undertake to reduce their greenhouse CO2 emissions by 80 percent by 2050 compared to 1990s. By 2023, the members of the association will carry out investments and upgrades for climate protection of around HUF 100 billion. Finally, once again, the Hungarian Parliament recently adopted the fully Paris-compatible second national climate strategy. Dear Parliament, Of course, NÉS II. It is also integral to the wider energy and climate policy ideas of the government that we want to provide clean, smart and affordable energy to all Hungarian energy consumers. It is clear because it increases the weight of low or zero emission technologies in domestic energy use, encourages energy efficiency and thus strengthens our energy independence. It supports energy-saving solutions at all levels of the value chain to minimise negative impacts on the environment, climate and consumers' energy expenditure. It is smart because it builds on the latest technological achievements in order to ensure a high level of energy services at the lowest possible cost. During the transformation of the energy sector, we aim to create new market opportunities for innovative domestic businesses and strengthen research and development activities in the sector. Finally, our energy strategy is one that provides affordable services, because we are developing a diversified supply portfolio and a regulatory environment in which domestic energy developments support the competitiveness of the Hungarian economy in a sustainable way and increase consumer welfare. In order to achieve this vision, we aim to implement the following four programme points: on the one hand, we place the Hungarian consumer in the focus of the national energy strategy, on the other hand, we strengthen the security of our energy supply, on the third, we implement climate-friendly transformation of the energy sector and take advantage of the economic development potential of energy innovation and climate change. Dear Parliament, Balance of prevention, adaptation and awareness-forming in climate protection; design based on the results of science; emission reduction policy conducive to innovative economic development; guaranteeing clean, smart, affordable energy for Hungarian consumers; inclusiveness and cooperation in planning and implementation we offer you and Hungarian citizens this vision in the field of integrated energy and climate policy. In the design and implementation of domestic climate change measures, the countdown has started, and we have to fight together in a battle that if we lose, all our other battles and struggles will be lost. Reducing the expected social impact of climate change and improving the adaptability of society is now our daily task, the efforts to slow down climate change and to adapt to changed circumstances can be effective if measures are surrounded by professional, scientific, policy and social consensus. This can only be achieved through common thinking and effort. That should be the case and I hope that today's debate will be about this. Thank you very much for your attention. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]]

u2018-12-12-14	Thank you very much for the floor, Mr President, and for the information on the remaining timeframe. The UN's climate change objectives include education, awareness-raising and improving human and institutional capacity in relation to climate change mitigation, adaptation, mitigation and early warning. A number of UN Member States' action plans on climate change include actions related to the fourth sustainable development goal, quality education, notably awareness raising, content regulation, development of targeted climate change programmes and support for related research. In Hungary, the second national climate change strategy, which provides an outlook for the period 2017-2030 and 2050, sets out short, medium- and long-term targets and directions for action. On the basis of the strategy in force as from 31 October 2018, a three-year action plan should be drawn up within six months, which will include concrete measures for climate protection. It sets out 10 directions for action in the field of education. Among these, it is important to analyse framework curricula, higher education training requirements and teacher training systems to further strengthen climate change and sustainability approaches and to review administrative exam material in terms of sustainability and knowledge on climate change. Higher education institutions support education efforts on sustainability and climate change with a large part of different programmes. In November 2018, the Hungarian National Committee of UNESCO held a meeting at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, in which the Ministry of Human Resources also played an active role. A series of training modules are emerging from the National University of Public Service. The subject of climate change was in order in the various content of the regulatory documents created after the change of regime, as a result of which it has been an integral part of the knowledge transmitted by the Hungarian education system for decades. The growing generation must know and appreciate the rich variety of life forms both in nature and in culture. You need to learn to use resources consciously, sparingly and responsibly, with regard to their ability to renew. In this context, public education institutions should prepare students to exercise the obligations and rights of citizens in relation to the environment and explain to them the social and economic processes that can lead to changes and crises in their narrower and wider environments. In addition to the daily practice of learning-teaching and community life, schools need to support students in building their sense of responsibility for the natural and built environment and the future of our communities by organising project days and thematic weeks at institutional level, by engaging in local, regional, national and international programmes requiring student cooperation and activity. At the same time, it is clear that, in order to understand the risks posed by irresponsible management of substances to the diversity of living things, their way of life and their appearance, and their own responsibility for shaping a sustainable future, teachers should set a credible example and provide pupils with knowledge and opportunities to gain experience that relate to the conscious, economical and responsible use of resources. The eco-school programme maintained by EMMI and its implementing institutions, the network of eco-schools in Hungary, is internationally recognised and good practice. Since 2004, nearly a thousand schools, 29 percent of Hungarian schools have joined the initiative and have won the eco-school or eco-school title by tender. In these institutions, they deal with environmental awareness, sustainability, environmental health and global responsibility in a systematic, whole institutional approach, i.e. for all employees, students and students. The school deals with the emphasis, transfer of environmental values, such as the organisation and implementation of waste shipments, field occupations integrated into the local curriculum, forest schools, theme days, implementation of thematic weeks or community service in schools, the recommendation and organisation of environmental activities for students. Many eco-schools operate energy commandos: with the active and conscious participation of students, the energy-saving operation of the school's building is achieved. During the 2018-19 academic year, thousands of primary schools and secondary schools are among the public education institutions that pay special attention to environmental awareness and sustainability, which means that almost every third Hungarian school. 48 first eco-schools, 54 renewed and 56 eternal eco-school titles were handed over in this school year. About 79 percent of eco-schools belong to the school district centers, 6 percent are agricultural vocational schools, 5 percent are member institutions of the ITM, economic or technical training centers, and more and more are ecclesiastical schools in the network, with a ratio of about 6 percent at present. The network of green vodák in Hungary operates with the coordination of the Agricultural Ministry, and it is a member of a total of 898 institutions. According to the definition of the criteria, the Green Kindergarten programme includes commitment to the pedagogy of sustainability, emphasising the knowledge, protection and preservation of local values, and giving priority to environmental education, building on its development-enhancing activities, as well as reflecting its features in its infrastructure and its operation. Thus, the Green Kindergartens, which also take an institutional approach, also contribute to the foundation of climate change approach and awareness by means of sustainable education. A total of 38 kindergartens in the 2018 tender year, of which 20 institutions won the title of Green Kindergarten for the first time, 7 institutions for the second time and 7 institutions for the third time, while four institutions were entitled to the title of Green Kindergarten. The Eco-school system was also recognised by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe by officially qualified it as good practice in the field of sustainability education. In the case of targeted grants for the development of infrastructure in public education institutions, the assessment of proposals was based on the sustainability requirement and on the exploitation of renewable energy sources as much as possible. Within the framework of the National Public Education Infrastructure Development Programme launched in 2014, 158 projects will be completed in 600 schools worth HUF 125 billion, of which 51 new swimming pools, 47 new gymnasiums will be built, 44 new classroom investments and development will be completed, and 15 new schools and a new kindergarten development and construction will be completed. More than 56 of these projects could already be transferred, 13 new schoolhouses, 22 new gymnasiums were set up at locations, 15 schools could be expanded with new classrooms, 4 schools and a new kindergarten. In the case of targeted aid for infrastructure development, the assessment of the proposal was aimed at keeping the sustainability requirements in mind and at exploiting renewable energy sources as much as possible. The important programme on climate change is that EMMI's field of public education has identified three areas to be achieved in the development of students' awareness, one of which is environmental awareness in the context of the sustainability week from the 2015-2016 academic year. As part of the Sustainability Week, programmes for pupils will include pedagogue training, awareness-raising activities with the participation of volunteer professionals and other accompanying events. There is an increasing number of schools joining the Sustainability Week programmes. During the 2017-18 academic year, 320,000 students from 1522 schools, then 19 thousand classes attended the week of the topic, and 430 teachers participated in the teacher trainings related to the programmes. The main topics of the Sustainability Week were selective waste collection, conscious shopping, climate change, animal protection, conscious nutrition and ecological footprints in 2016 and the protection of nature, everyday environmental protection and consumer protection in 2017. [[14.50]] In this academic year, action against climate change is a priority theme for sustainability week. In addition to the active participation of students in school projects, schools, teachers and students are invited to participate in the thematic week with various interactive programmes, applications and competitions. Professionals committed to sustainability can participate in school programmes on a voluntary basis. With the support of the EMMI, the one-week event entitled The World's Greatest Teacher is being held for the third year. In 2018, 3540 schools of 512 schools joined the event. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Within the framework of the World's Greatest Teachers, educators around the world will hold a class for disciples on a given week in September of that year. The lesson is supported by online downloadable lesson plans prepared by the UN expert team. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. The World's Greatest Teacher has had his or her experiences, such as conscious nutrition and community activity. In addition to continuing the course, national applications have been announced, such as thinking globally, acting locally. It was possible to apply for Community action at local level, which was one of the themes of the Sustainability Week. During the development of educational competences for sustainable education, education offers awareness-raising programmes for all age groups and subjects. Several teacher training programmes have been developed on this subject over the past five years. There are a number of teachers' further trainings linked to scientific education or other fields in the accreditation list of the Education Office, which prepare teachers to help their students become motivated to take action against climate change, equipped with both information and methodological experience. Dear House, My time frame has expired, but I would like to draw attention to the fact that we have prepared a short-term, medium-term and long-term action plan not only in the field of education but also in the field of health, on which, in particular, the National Climate Change Strategy 23/2018 has been developed. OGY also has a decision. Thank you very much.
u2018-12-12-15	Thank you very much, Secretary of State, Bence Rétvári. Dear Parliament, It is now time for the speeches by its representatives. In the first round, the keynote speakers will be held within 15-15 minutes of each group of representatives. First, I give the floor to Mr János Bencsik, the lead speaker of the Fidesz Group. You have the floor.
u2018-12-12-16	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, First of all, we need to focus on the nature of change. Thank God, few today argue that it is basically a natural process, a naturally recurring process that occurs in the order of about 10,000 years each year. Therefore, it is worth considering for all of us the earth's history of what conditions of earth history were ten thousand years ago or just three million years ago, the natural environment in which the living things that were found here on Earth had to exist at that time. For by the middle of this century, climate change trends predicted by our scientists are creating climate relations that were last found in Earth's history 3 million years ago. It is therefore primarily adaptation that is important for us. We must start by using the resources that we have in nature in a meaningful and sustainable way for our own benefit. Because if we don't do this, then this natural cycle change of climate change will be done with the human effects that have contributed significantly to the transformation of the Earth's surface and air layer in the last 200-250 years, following the emergence of the industrial revolution and fossil fuels. It must therefore also be said that it is the human form of conduct that affects the future of all of us. The issue of value choice is the slowing down of sustainability and climate change, a value choice that stimulates us to save, to use energy efficiently and to use materials. I could say that the attitude of the opposition representatives was a bad example a few hours ago; they chose this value, and they belong to the political factions that call themselves green, that at least ten taels of paper and trash were thrown into our necks. They are not in the Chamber, although they have initiated this debate. What is the nature of change? Minister Szijjártó mentioned migration, migration, which is basically for economic livelihoods. The driving force of this is to change the conditions of existence and production. It is the change in living and production conditions that drives the larger masses out and guide them towards continents where these living conditions are more friendly and less human effort is needed to ensure the same standard of living, that livelihood. But we must not only prepare ourselves here in Europe and in Hungary, in the Carpathian Basin, to deal with problems related to economic immigrants, but we must also address three issues that the representatives of the government have outlined briefly here: water security, quantitative and qualitative availability of water, food security, which is also partly related to the availability of water, because it is necessary to provide good quality water for irrigation in order to maintain agricultural crops, and the basis for our food. And equally important is the safety of housing, which includes the wind resistance, heat resistance, UV resistance of buildings in which we live our lives, whether our homes or our public institutions. So these are the three most important issues that the government will have to address over the next few decades, so that by the middle of the century both water security, food security, housing security, fixed infrastructure, and therefore critical infrastructure, which are needed for transport, energy supply, will be available in an appropriate capacity and security. I mentioned a change of perspective and life practice, a need for savings and efficiency. Saving means choosing values. This is why it is important, as Parliamentary Secretary of State Rétvári has also outlined in the area of education, that the transfer of knowledge on sustainability should already be included in the National Basic Teaching Plan and pedagogical Education. It is very important to ensure that those resources, be raw materials, be energy sources, are used effectively. And this is where innovation is connected. It is no coincidence that the Ministry of Innovation and Technology is dealing with the issue of climate change, not only because they set this very nice course for themselves, that it is necessary to achieve a championship, and not only would they like to be champions themselves, but they want to see the entire government activity and Hungary as champions in the field of climate change, but indeed, this is true, more efficient use of raw materials and energy requires innovation, it requires thinking and development, and in this we Hungarians have always been good at it. If we can produce technologies that can be sold on the world market, and in addition within the framework of international climate agreements, we need to make use of it and build on it; as has been said, in the field of drinking water, sewage treatment or even agriculture, they provide an excellent opportunity for the Hungarian economy. [[15.00]] Slow down, that's what I'd say. This reduction of emissions is a very nice concept, but we will not change the trend, we can slow down the rate of climate change. For my part, I would be happy with that, and the government should be more ambitious, because that is what we expect of him, but what we can really do is slow down this climate change process, we must do it. The other very important issue is adaptation. Building modernisation is an excellent opportunity in the area of slowing down. The primary task and obligation of the state and the local authorities is to make buildings and facilities that accommodate public services time-proof for climate change, so those extreme weather conditions can be weathered and endured without damage by our most important public institutions. These include hospitals, elderly homes, law enforcement and defence facilities, but these include our educational institutions in a different order of importance, because in the case of a war, in an exceptional situation, it is always primarily the elderly, the vulnerable, the care of patients, and the children. So there are really great opportunities in the modernisation of buildings, in energy efficiency investments, in the use of renewable energy sources, there are also economic recovery opportunities, in the budget there is potential for saving, and in the quality of supply for users of these services there is an increase of their own. I would just like to give you an example: when, in my own constituency, we completed the modernisation of the county hospital and finally the thermal insulation took place, we replaced the windows through which the draft and the patients were escorted out, the patients who got in and were receiving care were able to use the service in more comfortable conditions. Or how important it is for a school to have a small display panel in the community space, in the school hall, and during the inter-school break, children can look at how much electricity the solar system that has been installed on top of the school at that time of the day for entertainment. And then in class, the teacher or teacher can talk about energy saving, the cleanness of renewable energies, the importance of these, sustainability, the meaningful use of existing resources. The Ministry launched similar programmes in the public sector for the exchange of household appliances, the use of renewable energies, and the provision of precipitation water drainage. In the case of small settlements, one of the main objectives of the territorial operational programme is the reconstruction or construction of local, municipal precipitation water drainage systems for the prevention and elimination of lightning floods. So we can list a multitude of practical examples in the field of drainage and water retention. It should also be about social and economic sustainability, because we are often told by the opposition that in recent years the trend has been broken that greenhouse gas emissions have decreased steadily and have increased by 1 percent in the last two years and 2 percent in total; we are still the top riders in Europe. But, for Christ's sake, let's realize that you have to make a living. So people have to live, they have to work, they have to work somewhere, they have to produce value, they have to support themselves and their families, and that requires industry and agriculture. We need an industry that is a material and energy-saving industry, and it also offers jobs to many people, including the possibility of innovation, so it is not just a assembly activity, it is an industry with greater added value, but in recent years such improvements have been made throughout the country. As a result, emissions have increased somewhat, but the vast majority of emissions do not come from industry and not from agriculture, but from transport, and from transit transport, which is driving through Hungary, which means that the M1 motorway needs three lanes, because we simply can't drive it here anymore, because there is so much transit traffic through Hungary. Now, there's a discharge that can affect up to 1-2 percent of the total emissions. In the field of agriculture, about adaptation: the process that the agricultural purse has started should be further bred and selected for the plants that are drought-tolerant, because we will not have enough irrigation water in the long term to maintain the level of agriculture and ensure the stability of our food, even to maintain our ability to export. Not to mention that a significant part of our land, as our former Minister of Agriculture said to us several times before, Sándor Fazekas said to us within the Cabinet, watering may lead to a state that significantly impairs the cultivation and productivity of that area, so we can make a profit in the short term, but in the medium term, such artificial intervention will be more damaging in the long term. For this reason, it is important that in the field of irrigation, not watering, but irrigation, technologies are selected, introduced and supported from tender sources that use as little water as possible, with the highest added value for the plant. So innovation and knowledge transfer are important opportunities, cooperation with local governments and reliance on them are important, especially in large cities. So this Under 2, which was mentioned here by the Minister, the metropolitan money core to be spent on energy efficiency of HUF 100 billion, is an important step to enable us to use the strategic framework, the action plans after the adoption of the strategy, regional, municipal climate strategies, development programming or the available domestic and European Union funds as a matter of cause and practical use. This is how the strategic framework for climate change is put together. [[The President shall ring a bell to indicate the expiry of the time limit.]] both in the area of slowing down and adapting. Thank you very much for your attention. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]]
u2018-12-12-17	Thank you very much, Congressman János Bencsik. Mr Lajos Kepli, Jobbikos, is not in the Chamber, so I give the floor to Mr András Aradszki, the lead speaker of the KDNP Group.
u2018-12-12-18	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Mr President, Dear House, Ladies and gentlemen of the State Secretary. Today's political debate on climate change is indeed an opportunity for meaningful, objective discussion of the fact that affects our future most, but it seems to me that this opportunity is being used by those who are capable of meaningful and objective discourses, those who are unable to do so are not here; that is the conclusion that comes to me. I am very sorry that the kind of hypocritical attitude we have seen many times by the opposition over the last few years has not gained any more publicity. It is also obvious that there are economic, technological, social and political aspects of the complex analysis resulting from climate change, which can be an important prerequisite for proper and appropriate guidance, for counter-strategies, namely halting climate change, maximising warming. It is undoubtedly a fact that human activity contributes to atmospheric warming experienced in mankind's modern age, in addition to having specific contributions from the Earth's life cycle. [[15.10]] I believe that humankind must take the steps it has taken to remedy the emerging threat. This is a positive approach for us, because if man has an impact on the worsening of the situation, on atmospheric warming and the climate change associated with it, then mankind must also be able to maintain it at an acceptable level, because if we do not do so, then our home, the Earth, can cease to be the living space of mankind. In Pope Francis's Laudato si' encyclical he described today's challenge and the objective existence of his responsibility: consumption, waste and the pace of environmental damage exceeded the planet's potential, so that the current way of life, as it is not sustainable, can only lead to disasters, as in some areas it actually happens again. Easing the impact of the current imbalance depends on what we are doing now, especially when we take into account the responsibility that we are attributed to those who will have to bear the most serious consequences. In addition to encouraging hope and hope, it is time for mankind to take action, which is a time for joint action, considering the direction of social policy change and analysing global challenges. An important step in this series of actions was the Paris agreement concluded in 2015, which, I see and see many of us as providing an appropriate framework for the management of international climate policy after 2020, which includes the necessary guidelines for the implementation of EU and Hungarian climate action. The document aims to keep the average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius and to ensure that the XXI. By the second half of the century, it envisages a state in which total greenhouse gas emissions cannot be greater than that which nature can balance, i.e. greenhouse gas concentrations will not continue to increase in the atmosphere. This is a very important goal that humanity can do the most. The document also stated that fossil-based energy production and transport are the main causes of this climate change on the human side. At the time of the agreement, the European Union, on the basis of the mandate of the Member States of the European Union, represented the common position which was included in the Paris Agreement, and the European Union and the representatives of the Member States at the meeting itself played a very active role in enabling the Paris Conference to make the fullest possible commitments. In this, the position of the Hungarian Government was fully consistent with the EU positions adopted there. The Union has moved on because, in the framework of the Paris Agreement and in order to implement it, the Energy Union concept has emerged, in which it has been adopted after tough discussions, with effect from December 2018, to develop integrated national energy and climate plans for the Member States and to submit them to the European Commission, so that the GHG reduction targets can be set and defined at a consolidated European level. Therefore, the European Union and Hungary within it can make a significant contribution in terms of eliminating, reducing global warming and reducing greenhouse gas emissions if these plans are implemented. Hungary has a goal and a vision that greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. There is a possibility of this, 23/2018. a second national climate change strategy for the period 2018-2030, adopted by a parliamentary decision, which provides for or refers to a greenhouse gas emission reduction path for 2050. I think it is important to point out that the reduction of greenhouse gases is not only a way for energy production and transport to move in a decarbonised direction, but also a way that, following the principle that unused energy is the cheapest energy, we can take significant steps towards increasing energy efficiency, i.e. reducing energy use. I think it is important that we also move with European trends in this regard, but we do have additional additional additional steps that we rarely talk about. This is what I consider the family home creation programme to be, because it goes hand in hand with the renewal of the housing stock, and according to the existing construction rules it can and will mean significant energy savings for the population, which I think will make a significant, tangible contribution to the improvement of energy efficiency in Hungary. In this respect, it is true that the development of the economy, at least in Hungary, does not involve greenhouse gas emissions, or at least does not entail a proportionate contribution. I can say that during the industrial development and economic development of the last few years the Hungarian economy, the Hungarian industry, has done well, because the specific greenhouse gas emissions have decreased significantly. What we can do about energy is a big issue for Hungary as well. Hungary is in the process of transition to low-carbon energy production, and I think it is very important to underline that one of our most important climate policy instruments in energy production is the maintenance of nuclear power generation, which provides a background, a basic power plant system for climate-dependent renewable energy production. There is also a great deal of progress to be made in this country. Within the next 4-5 years, 3 gigawatts of solar power will be built, the actual generation of which will be much less, but it also shows that the transition that the European Union has launched with the last winter energy package will not fall behind in that transition, but, together with the main lines, will be able to move forward towards low-carbon energy production along its national interests and by taking advantage of its economic benefits. If we look at the global world and look at the newly published material of the International Energy Agency, we can see that, in addition to the big decisions, CO2 emissions from energy use or production will increase at global level by 2040. This may also have a positive reading. This is the period that we need to switch to a low-carbon system, and this transition may have the consequences of increasing CO2 emissions worldwide, but it is also a positive scenario that for the first time this year there was less than a billion people in energy poverty, so less than a billion people do not have energy, primarily electronic energy, and this is a big step forward for humanity. But it is also true that there are questions to be decided about the transition. Sometimes one feels in the world that the use of nuclear energy sources and the use of renewables have developed a belief debate over the past decades, such as on migration, to look at another political aspect. This debate has hindered the spread and use of purely producing nuclear energy in low-carbon energy production, which means that by about 2030 Chinese nuclear power capacity will be greater than that of the United States and the European Union, while we will be fighting how we can maintain low-carbon production. [[15.20]] It also shows that the Germans, who do not follow the Hungarian example, or other examples of European countries, by putting into the nuclear production system, by using fossil energy, in addition to spending a lot of money on the system of renewables, are noticeably increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This debate must be put to an end as soon as possible, balance the systems with equal weight and equal support, use the complementary low-carbon energy generation instruments with the same acceptance, and, therefore, I think it is very important to stress once again that I believe that Hungary is following good directions in this energy strategy. Of course, it is important to take significant innovative steps for low carbon energy production. In energy storage, in the refrocescence of spent fuel and in the flexibility and smartness of supply systems, as has already been said, Hungarian intellectual capacity is likely to be available, and Hungary can contribute to achieving lower CO2 emissions in this respect as well. In conclusion, I can say that the conditions for low-carbon energy production will be guaranteed in Hungary. However, I must say that it is worth talking not only about energy production in the context of climate change, but also about the need for natural resources of the Earth's population, its emissions of pollutants, as compared to the current resources of the Earth each year, indicating over-use, which threatens the sustainability of the created world entrusted to us. This system of instruments needed to ensure sustainability must be set up with a common approach, with individual and national responsibility. In this world, the world has advanced, but not enough. Hungary is an active participant in positive initiatives, for example, it first ratified and incorporated the Paris Climate Convention into the Hungarian legal order. Hungary's contribution to over-eating is not a significant one, especially when we take into account the economically developed countries, the US, Australia and Luxembourg. However, our country cannot give up on increasing the standard of living of its economy, citizens, but sustainability challenges must be taken into account. The key to the country's development is the increase in the efficiency of economic production, which is synonymous with saving energy consumption, digitalisation, carbon monoxide-free energy production, efficient recycling of waste, eectrification of transport, shortening the market path of food. These described goals, which appear in the Hungarian energy strategy, appear in the Hungarian climate protection goals, KDNP can and will always support them in the future. Thank you very much for your attention. [[A round of applause from the ruling parties.]]
u2018-12-12-19	Thank you very much, Congressman Aradski. Dear Parliament, Mr Lajos Kepli, as I indicated, is not in the Chamber; Zita Gurmai, MSZP; László Hajdu, DK; Erzsébet Schmuck, LMP; Olivio Kocsis-Cake, Dialogue and Members are not in the Chamber; they have applied to be the lead speaker. This brings us to the end of the keynote speeches. I will give the floor to Congressman János Bencsik in two minutes, Fidesz.
u2018-12-12-20	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, Today's debate on climate change was initiated by the Dialogue Group. We were available for this dialogue, we prepared for it, we presented our position, the government presented its position and the government's work on climate change, and the plans, the strategies and action plans it intends to implement in the coming years. Moreover, the LMP has also asked for a doubling of its own time frame, to which we have contributed in the House Committee, but on the part of the opposition groups, although the initiative came from there, there is no great interest in the parliamentary debate. And we do not usually argue about these issues, but basically discuss them in our workshops and our Cabinets, in both groups, in the KDNP and in the Fidesz Group, so we know each other's position. In fact, we are trying to show these interrelated positions in the strategy and in the action plans, so that the mayors of our political community can be implemented at the end. So we do not want to argue with each other, but rather we want to give the government the opportunity to sum up what was said during the debate, to respond to it, and then all those who wish to make their speeches after the parliamentary sitting can do it. Thank you so much for your attention. [[A round of applause from the ruling parties.]]
u2018-12-12-21	Thank you very much, Congressman Benchik. Dear Parliament, I ask that in the remaining timeframes, someone else wishes to make use of their right to speak. Please signal. [[There's no candidate.]] I don't see a signal. The political debate is closed. Dear Parliament, I will give the floor to the representatives of the government in a 20-minute time frame. I'm asking who wants to respond. I give the floor to Secretary Peter Kaderja.
u2018-12-12-22	Mr President, Dear Parliament, I would like to thank the government and myself very much for their comments on the focus points of constructive, reinforcing and future climate and energy policy. These contributions will, of course, be taken into account in the design of the programme and the functioning and actions of the government. Let me just mention, in conclusion, that I came back from the COP24 conference this morning from Katowica, where I listened to our Polish colleague, who told me that in Poland a very ambitious electromobility programme was being launched. It occurred to me that this is actually a rather strange situation, because in Poland the electricity used to drive electric cars is very polluting, because it is almost entirely produced on a carbon basis. So I would just like to ask you, in the future, to support the government's ability to jointly implement a more sophisticated, truly integrated energy, climate and economic development strategy. Thank you very much for your attention. [[A round of applause from the ruling parties.]]
u2018-12-12-23	Thank you, Mr. Peter Kaderjak State Secretary. Dear Parliament, We have reached the end of today's agenda. It is now time for the speeches after the agenda. Péter Ágh Fideszes, representative of North Vas County, applied for a post-meeting address. I give the floor to Congressman Péter Ágh in a five-minute time frame.
u2018-12-12-24	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear House, Several settlements and communities in my constituency celebrated an anniversary this year that highlighted the performance of the people of North Vas County. In the case of Sárvár, Celldömölk and Répcelak, I have already drawn attention to these, and now allow me to report on other local jubileees that allow us to bow our heads to the performance of former and modern people living in this corner of Vas County. First of all, in connection with the end of World War I 100 years ago, allow me to pay tribute to all those who came to the front, died a heroic death, and to their relatives who fed their spiritual strength. Dear House, This year we find dates in the history of several of our settlements that show how many centuries have passed since their first mention in the struggle for survival. In the case of Söpte 750, in the case of Rábapaty, it is 725 years since the name of the village was first registered in a diploma. The citizens of all three settlements are actively taking action today so that they can continue to host many in the future. [[15.30]] This is the case in Tormásliget, which has become an independent settlement for 25 years now. A serious anniversary was also remembered by the Kőszeg Volunteer Fire Department, which was founded 150 years ago. Flame riders have always been expected when there's trouble and thanks for it. This year it made it even nicer for them to make the new firehouse with government support in Kőszeg. This town is also connected to the Dominican sisters who arrived in Hungary 150 years ago. Their first house and a school for raising girls were founded in Kőszeg. This year, they celebrated a quarter-century jubilee of re-launching after the regime change, which was memorable to the construction of the new sports hall, also with government support. As regards Kőszeg, we can also welcome the fact that there are major renovations in one of the best high school institutions in the country, Jurisich High School, whose main building was started 110 years ago this year. In Sárvár, besides the anniversary of the city, we can bow down to the 50th anniversary of the Technical Secondary School and the Secondary School of Barabás, the 25 years of the Civil Guard Association, and the five successful years of the Orathorical Choir. In my constituency, two NGOs celebrated. I would like to highlight the Gencsapát Traditional Association, the 80th anniversary of which we were able to bow down before its 25th anniversary. In the same way, the Kemenesházi Citera Ensemble and Népdalkör remembered its 40th anniversary. In both civil organizations, great people work so that Hungarian culture can survive in this corner of Vas county. Dear House, We are grateful to all organizations, institutions and settlements celebrating the anniversary for their contribution to the construction of Vas county with their work and activities. Thank you for that, for they give us all an example of how to build Iron County, how to create good and lasting things. We will continue to work with the government to continue to leave a trail worthy of memory in the coming period, based on their example, and to build the County of Iron in a worthy way. Thank you for your attention. Happy birthday to the Iron County. [[Applause in the pro-government benches.]]
u2018-12-12-25	Thank you very much, Congressman Peter Agh. I'm going to ask if someone wants to answer what's been said. [[There's no candidate.]] They're signaling no. After the agenda, Mr Róbert Simon, from the Fidesz Group, spoke on the title of infrastructure improvements in Győr. You have the floor, Congressman.
u2018-12-12-26	Thank you very much for the floor, Mr President. Dear Minister, Ladies and gentlemen, My constituency, Győr, has one of the most dynamically developing economies in Hungary. In recent years, measures and developments have been launched and implemented in and around the city that make the economic environment even more attractive in the county seat in Kisalföld. Just looking at the developments in recent years, a number of new investments have been made, which have indirectly facilitated not only the lives of companies but also the lives of the people who live there. It is enough to think about the construction of the main road No.813, which, avoiding the city of Győr from the eastern direction, connects the M1 motorway with the main road No. 14, its total length is 13,4 km. The route was built at three stages, from which the first phase was delivered in 2015 and the second at the end of 2016. This connects the industrial park to the Audi plant and the motorway M19 and main road 1. The third phase was completed in March 2018, and as part of the project, a new Mosoni-Danube bridge of 395 meters was created, which was the final stage of road 813 bypassing Győr. In addition, this summer the two-track section of the opening of Highway 83 in Győr was completed. The M15 motorway, the extension of the M1 motorway between the Rajka border and the construction of the M85 main road between the Csorna-Sopron border are also ongoing. Infrastructural developments serve the needs of the Győr people and are always forward-looking. It is important for infrastructure to be seen as actually an investment, which, while costing it now, serves to strengthen it in the long run, thereby paying off. In recent years, Győr-Moson-Sopron County has built more than 100 kilometers of high-quality roads, along which the city's economic life has also undergone unprecedented development and growth. The above connection is well demonstrated by the government's national transport development strategy, in which the aim was to renew the country's motorway network of 2500 billion forints in six years and to build almost a thousand kilometres to maintain competitiveness. On the basis of the above, I would like to ask the Minister with respect that priority road improvements are expected in Győr. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to Minister's reply. [[Applause in the pro-government benches.]]
u2018-12-12-27	Thank you very much, Congressman Robert Simon. I give the floor to Secretary of State Péter Szijjártó.
u2018-12-12-28	Thank you for the floor. Mr President, Mr President, please allow me, before I give an answer to my fellow Member, Mr Simon Róbert, to pay a special tribute to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Cambodia, who is visiting Budapest today [[Applause in the pro-government benches. Prak Sokhon stands up in the box to thank you for your applause.]] Our meeting was planned south, which, due to the known circumstances, slipped somewhat. Now the Minister for Foreign Affairs can experience a more peaceful period of Parliament's operation. Hungary places particular emphasis on cooperation with ASEAN, Mr President. In South East Asia, there are the fastest-growing economies in the world, and we have also put our economic cooperation with Cambodia in a new dimension, and we support closer cooperation between the European Union and Cambodia. I apologize, Mr. President, for starting my answer with this detour. Thank you for giving me permission to do this. Honourable Congressman, Hungary's economy is in a state of dimensional shift, when we have practically reached the level of total employment. What matters now is not only that we are taken into account as a production site by the companies that make the largest international investments, but they bring new technologies to Hungary, their development processes, and we are the first to use technologies that determine competitiveness in the new world economy era. Győr is, in this respect, the centre of a priority area in Hungary. Győr is home to the world's largest automotive engine factory, Audi employs more than 13 thousand people in Győr and Győr. However, the service industry around it, suppliers, the university world justifies the need to pay particular attention to the development of the city of Győr in the future, especially in the light of the fact that the global economy changes are driven by the automotive industry, the automotive industry dictates the pace, and it is in our interest, as well as Hungarians, Hungary, to be as decisive as possible in the new automotive era. So in the traditional automotive era, we have become Europe's flagship, one of the most important automotive production sites, and we would like the same to happen in the innovative era of the automotive industry. Győr plays a prominent role in this respect, as Audi started production of electric motors in Győr in July, with which the Hungarian automotive industry was placed on a whole new shelf in the innovative automotive era. Of course, an inspiring, inspiring and attractive investment environment requires not only the lowest taxes in Europe, but not only the skills and industrious labour force, as I understand it here, but logistics plays an extremely important role in today's world, in the midst of today's global economic processes. Companies no longer like to store, but, after each production process, put the tools and parts into the next production process. Logistics, infrastructure and road construction should therefore be a priority in our economic development efforts. With all due respect, Congressman, the preparations for the construction of the new Mosoni-Duna Bridge have begun. The preparation and preparation of the studies necessary for the development of the eastern bypass road between Győr and the country has already started, as we want the traffic serving the city's industrial facilities and companies to be as low as possible on the city centre, thus reducing noise pollution and air pollution levels. [[15.40]] So I can tell the Member that Hungary's Government continues to prioritise development in Győr, and we are following the development of the city with infrastructure improvements. At the same time, I thank the Member for all the work that he has done to ensure that Győr remains one of the most attractive investment destinations for large foreign, large Hungarian and small and medium-sized Hungarian companies. Thank you very much for your work. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]]
u2018-12-12-29	Thank you very much, Minister of Foreign Affairs Péter Szijjártó. Dear Parliament, I myself welcome the Foreign Minister and his escort from Cambodia and wish for successful and successful negotiations. Dear Parliament, After the agenda, Ms Csöbör Katalin, Fidesz Group, spoke with the title of catching up the eastern part of the country. You have the floor, Congresswoman.
u2018-12-12-30	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear Minister, Dear House, In the last eight years, Hungary's economy has described historic developments, not only by fidesz politicians, but also by left-wing and even liberal economists. The peak of GDP was 7.4 percent in the third quarter of 2009, whereas now, in the third quarter of 2018, the Hungarian people produced the highest, plus 4.9 percent, of GDP. Meanwhile, unemployment declined from 9.6 percent in the second quarter of 2009 to 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2018, reaching practically total employment. But the activities of the Fidesz-KDNP government are not primarily justified by statistics. We have done a great deal to allow economic operators to look optimisticly, confidently into the future. The strengthening of foreign economic operators established in Hungary and Hungary and their confidence in Hungary are important to keep the Hungarian economy on the growth path. And this is good news for all Hungarians, because where companies plan to expand, it means that new jobs will be created, where Hungarian people will get jobs, and new Hungarian companies will be strengthened as suppliers or partners. This makes a significant contribution to the growth of Hungarian exports and the Hungarian economy. As a parliamentary representative of Miskolc and its surroundings, it is important to note that the effects of the economic recovery are concentrated not only in one region of Hungary, but in virtually all areas of Hungary this time. This is the best possible news for those areas that have less of renewal and confidence. More than anything, the fact is that in the three counties of North-East Hungary, Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, Hajdú-Bihar and Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg, local economic organizations significantly increased the value of new investments in the first half of 2018 compared to the data one year earlier. In the first half of the year, a new investment worth 104 billion HUF was made in Borsod County, 37 percent more than a year earlier. This increase was the largest in the rankings of the counties and the capital and was well above the 16 percent domestic average. It's no less important to me that unemployment in Borsod County has dropped by 10 percent in ten years. The figures also show that the economic policy moves in recent years have also put the regions that have developed slower, providing new jobs, new opportunities and livelihoods for the families living there, catching up with the regions of Central and Western Hungary. For the above reasons, I would like to ask you, Minister, for an honour's reply: can we hope that the pace of catching up will continue to be sustainable in the north-eastern part of the country; and how can you contribute to further development of the region, for example, by maintaining and improving the airport in Miskolc? Thank you very much. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]]
u2018-12-12-31	Thank you very much, Congresswoman Csöbör. I give the floor to Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Péter Szijjártó.
u2018-12-12-32	Thank you for the floor. Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and In 2017, investments to Hungary broke all previous records and, looking at the data available until the end of October, 2018 will also be a record year in terms of investment in Hungary, exports from Hungary and the added value of jobs created by large investments. In addition, the automotive industry, which accounts for 28% of the Hungarian industrial output, showed a 5 percent increase in the first nine months, leading to the confidence that the performance of the automotive industry is not independent of Miskolc, and we have the good hope that this growth path will help maintain the growth rate of the economy as a whole above 4 percent. The congresswoman rightly said that investment in Hungary is now more territorially distributed than before. The large rural cities, if I may say so as a Győrian myself, are increasingly being treated as a priority by large companies when they are looking for an investment site, since the universities and secondary schools that operate there represent a major supply of labour, and Miskolc occupies a particularly respectable position in the ranking of these rural cities. I would like to tell you, honourable Member, that our cooperation with you and the city's leaders has always made it easier to negotiate with investors, because Miskolc has a parliamentary representative and city leaders who clearly understand what is needed to bring job-creating investments to their city, and I would like to express my thanks. With regard to North-East Hungary, I can tell you that there was 16.3 percent unemployment here in 2010 and 6.8 percent today. This is still above the national average, but given the desire to invest, I think that these scissors will soon narrow further. The northeast-Hungarian region, which you mentioned, had 23 investments in three counties from 96 that arrived in the country last year, so almost a quarter of them hadn't been before, and ten major investments were made in Borsod County last year. Bosch is constantly developing, just recently announced a new investment in Bosch, with Takata and Spinto increasing its capacity, and with the Japanese GS Yuasa moving in Miskolc has also been on the map of the new innovative automotive era, given the fact that the Japanese company is supplying parts for electric car batteries. As I have indicated to Member Mr Simon Róbert, of course we are aware that infrastructure and logistics are as important for the promotion of investment as low taxes and skilled labour, and therefore, of course, we consider the logistical needs and development issues of Miskolc as important in the government. From time to time, the question of Miskolc airport arises. Of course, we are positive about this issue. I think that in Miskolc there are already industrial capacities that justify easier access to the city. Moreover, we have seen in recent years how important an airport is in terms of competitiveness, so we are ready to discuss further with the congresswoman on the future of infrastructure developments, including air transport to Miskolc. Thank you very much, Mrs President, for raising this issue and thank you again for your cooperation in recent years. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]]
u2018-12-12-33	Thank you, Minister Szijjártó. Dear Parliament, We have reached the end of the speeches after the agenda. Thank you for your work. Parliament will resume its meeting at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. Meeting day's closed.
