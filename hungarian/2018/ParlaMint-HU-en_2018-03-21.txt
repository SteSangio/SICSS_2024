u2018-03-21-0	[[The people in this room stand up and greet the voters' community. When the chairman of the meeting takes his seat, the people in the room will sit down.]] Good afternoon, fellow Members. I warmly welcome all of you and welcome all of you who will follow our work today. I would like to inform you that László Földi and Dezső Liberty will be in charge of this meeting. As usual, we will start with speeches before the agenda. Please choose. Mr Bertalan Tóth of the MSZP Group asked for an address before the agenda. Here you go, Mr. Group Leader. You have the floor.
u2018-03-21-1	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, We're living in historical times. Since the change of regime, there hasn't been a case for a prime minister in function to threaten his own people. As you know, on 15 March, the current Prime Minister threatened people who wanted to change with legal and political sanctions. We're talking about millions of people. He said whoever's not with us is against us. You look familiar, don't you? You may also be familiar with the past, as eastern dictators are used to threaten the opposition with legal and political sanctions. This is XXI. It is unacceptable in Hungary in the first century. Ladies and gentlemen, I would have liked it if the current Prime Minister and the representatives of Fidesz had come to work today, although they are obviously running away from the confrontation again, and obviously Secretary Dömötör will tell us what other activities they might have had. But I can only accept four reasons why they're not here. One of the reasons could be that public lighting is being improved in several cities. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Oh, you're funny.]] And they are trying to recover 12 billion forints from István Tiborcz so that we can repay this money to the European Union. Or there could be a reason why Lajos Kósa is trying to smuggle 1300 billion forints back into the Hungarian budget somehow. Or they're testifying in an investigation into Antal Rogán's invention. And the fourth reason is that Zsolt Semjén is hiding a polar bear from him before he shoots it. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Your faction is not laughing!]] Furthermore, whatever they say is a lie; it is the same lie on which their governance and politics are based, which is neither Christian, nor social, nor democrat. Its sole purpose is to acquire Hungary's assets. The first of the Fidesz elite is not Hungary, but the looting of Hungary. Fidesz not only lies, but threatens, steals and cheats, creates a lack of peace and hatred between Hungarians outside and inside, incites refugees, but for a great deal of money tens of thousands of immigrants, including criminals, were allowed in unchecked. They're talking about democracy and the will of the majority, while they're in a minority, and they're about to cheat the election. Because we now know that with Fidesz help, fake parties and business parties have obtained data from Hungarian citizens or those who have just passed away. The biggest difference between Fidesz and the Fidesz politicians and the greats of our reform days they often mentioned is that while the Széchenyi sacrificed their own assets for Hungary, the Orbáns use the country to increase their own assets. Ladies and gentlemen, The question is whether we should let the Fidesz elite lie, steal, cheat; whether we should let Orbán lead Hungary out of the European Union; whether we should allow ourselves to be intimidated and threatened. We say no. That's enough! The interim mayor election in Hódmezővásárhely has shown that the people who want to change are in the majority. We call this majority to the polling booths on 8 April, because Orbán's system can be replaced and Hungary can be repaired. Now there is a chance, so we say to choose: East or West; peace or war; past or future; lag or development; enrichment of the fidesz elite or the well-being of everyone; or son-in-law or republic. Ladies and gentlemen, After 8 April, with the MSZP-Palogue Association, we will build a Hungary where power serves the people, and the eternal struggle will be replaced by safe, calm development. We want a European Hungary, a common country. Therefore, I can say again: those who are sick of Orbánok, Mészárosok, Tiborczok, Lázárok, Matolcsyk, Garancsik, Rogánok Hungary should come to vote on 8 April! Vote for the alliance of change, the candidates for the MSZP-Party speech and the list led by Gergely Christmas! Let's replace this cynical, corrupt gang together. For our future together, for Hungary. Thank you for your attention.
u2018-03-21-2	Thank you very much, Congressman. Mr Csaba Dömötör, State Secretary, replied to his speech before the agenda. Here you go, Secretary of State. You have the floor.
u2018-03-21-3	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. The fact that it is known to everyone about the topics on which today's debate was convened, and the fact that you almost didn't mention these topics at all, proves that the convening of this debate was also campaigning on behalf of the MSZP. It's steep that you're talking about a threat, the party that got shot in the crowd in 2006. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári and Dr. Pál Völner: That's right!]] And he even decorated the culprits. That's pretty steep. I always listen with interest to you here in Parliament, where you regularly make proposals that seem significant. However, it is worth noting that between these two meetings, the MSZP deals with everything but the affairs of the country and the matters proposed by itself. Instead, they spend most of their time fighting for positions. They're always arguing in front of the whole country about who's going to join the party, for example, Jobbik, who's going to quit, who's going to be on the run, all the cases that don't concern the voters, but just themselves. The country's interests are secondary to this great power struggle. And his indignity is well indicated by the fact that in recent days one of the main points of discussion for left-wing parties was whether Ferenc Gyurcsány had been drinking or not drinking, whether he was drunk or not. That's what we're feeling. [[Zoltán Grimlock: What have you been drinking? How much have you had to drink?]] That you can hold your next convention on the left slowly in a drink measurement or even in a kettle, and that you can quickly agree to draw the shortest in the end. [[13.10]] We don't know who's right about this scotch thing, by the way. [[Dr. László Kács: How can you not know?]] But what we see on the left is that Gyurcsány gives the beat again, he mixes the cards, he divides the cards, and as I overlook the Czeglédy case, he can even put the chips on the table. [[Zoltán Grimlock: What about Kósa?]] We wouldn't, by the way, discuss how they probe each other on the left, because it's more talkative than that that you've been proclaiming a shadow government. [[Dr. László Kács: My mother inherited four billion. Do you have Lali's number?]] This is an important development because at least everyone can see that the danger that the government and the ruling parties draw attention to here every week is very real. For example, their chief health officer, who was announced, campaigned alongside paying health care and collected signatures in addition to the visit fee, so you are not very interested, it seems that there was a referendum on this issue. And let's not talk about Tamás Wittinghoff proving a politician directly from the former SZDSZ. And if that's not enough, let's record that Gergely Christmas's party made a proposal for a 30 percent income tax rate, 30 percent instead of the current 15 percent. [[Zoltán Grimlock: That must be paid to Kósa, that 800 million!]] But the greatest danger is that in the shadow government of the MSZP we also find hard-line pro-immigration people. For example, there is Tamás Mellár, who said that Europe must learn to live with immigration, and he argued for quota, campaigned in the referendum. It is not beside the fact that the left seems to already have plans for implementing the resettlement: the party of Christmases proposed to open unused barracks to immigrants as early as 2015 [[Dr. László Kács: You opened one! Zoltán Grimlock: Those were stolen long ago, you didn't look after him!]] and there was a foreign-funded organisation that added to this by saying that schools and kindergartens should also be opened. Now we understand why Gergely Christmas's party voted 14 times in favour of resettlement quotas in Brussels. And by the way, Mr Group Leader, you voted in favour of this compulsory resettlement quota, look at the Protocol of 16 November in the European Parliament. We also understand from now on why Gergely Christmas is on tour with so much heat for EU leaders [[Dr. László Kács: A German billionaire died. I need Kósa's number.]] who are all pro-immigration. He does the same thing as László Botka, who promised to break down the fence, while otherwise denying it in front of the Hungarians. That is why Mrs Bangóné, who is present here, could say that she will answer whether or not they want to be introduced after 8 April. It's not fair, it's not fair to the Hungarian electorate. So that's it. We don't know much, we don't know much about their plans. [[Dr. László Kács: The boss of the Mercedes is also very sick. You don't have Lali's number?]] But what we do know is pretty bad, that's the best word: resettlements, immigration, gross tax increases, paying health care and sneaking back to SZDS. Honestly, it doesn't seem like a tempting offer, and I'm quite sure the Hungarians won't accept it. Thank you for listening. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties. Bangóné Borbély Ildikó: Continue stealing, this is your program!]]
u2018-03-21-4	Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Dear Parliament, How much longer? Mr Dániel Z. Kárpát has applied for a speech before the agenda with a title from the Jobbik Group. Congressman, you have the floor. Here you go.
u2018-03-21-5	Mr President, Dear House, It can be seen that after the historic fidesz failure and defeat in Hódmezővásárhely, Fidesz did not refund its position at all. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Where is Gábor Vona?]] , he did not look at himself, and he did not start to talk about the large number of results, but he is still busy with the blazing of political rivals, and it can also be seen that Fidesz-KDNP does not have a programme, has no vision for raising Hungary, is willing to deal only with migration topics in a false way. I could ask Mr Secretary of State here whether they can account for Lajos Kósa's statements over the last few weeks, whether it was the financial assassin of the century or the screw of the millennium. I would add that we are pleased that Lajos Kósa does not talk about the forint at least now, that those who have been damaged by foreign currency credit can be grateful to him that he does not decide on the exchange rate now or does not contribute to it. Secretary of State, I think that this question is almost unnecessary for you to ask, because your faction, the representatives of Fidesz-KDNP, simply do not come into your workplace. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Where is Gábor Vona?]] The government of cowardice, trying to make itself look massive and powerful, doesn't come into your workplace. What do they take their salary for? Where are you? [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Why isn't Gábor Vona coming to work?]] Mr State Secretary, you can intervene, but if you had secured the capacity to debate, you could have pressed a button, contributed to a substantive debate, say, in order to resolve the situation of those who have suffered foreign exchange credit. But you were cowards, you were cowards again, just like your prime minister is a coward, because he refuses to sit down for a presidential candidate debate with Prime Minister Gábor Vona. [[György Szilágyi: That's right!]] It's a shame, it's a shame that a government that demonstrates itself to be so strong is such a coward, he doesn't have the guts to argue about intelligent solutions! Speaking of which, according to the Secretary of State, you are the only people protecting Hungary against migration, I regret to report that there is only one government and it is known in Hungary, which has implemented and implemented a voluntary programme of conscious resettlement, and this is Fidesz-KDNP. And if your representatives in the European Parliament a few days ago support a budget that supports a migrant fund, supports the resettlement, housing, subpoenaed integration of migrants, then how do they look their voters in the eye of the Soros posters, and how does the rhetorical fraud that you are doing here in Hungary, in the light of 2300 protected by Szilárd Németh? Fidesz fellow Members, please be honest. The Geneva Convention did not oblige you to even develop a housing programme for your hosts. The Geneva Convention didn't even oblige you to educate these gentlemen and ladies with quotes from the CSOK recruitment possibilities. I have to tell you what you're doing is a fraud of the century: you don't have a program, you don't have a vision, you don't dare enter into meaningful debates, even though you could still do so after the historic fall of the beaver farm, that you're talking about substantive issues, where you have apparent results, let's say, family politics. It can be said that you will retain the system of family tax incentives when you go to the Jobbik government, you will expand them, but you have bled to death in the most important area in the face of all kinds of fidesz dreams: the number of births alive... [[Dr. Völner to Paul:]] Don't smile because it's not funny. Once again, the number of living births has decreased, in the midst of a housing crisis and housing cataclysm, you are unable to ensure that young Hungarians remain in this country. [[13.20]] Hundreds of thousands of people vote with their feet exactly who could deliver and take on the Hungarians of the future here in Hungary, and although Mr. State Secretary is still laughing, this is such a sad topic that a common national minimum should be placed on the table with a normal, cross-governmental programme. Well, that's why you should take part in these debates, and in order to put the exchange rate conversion into the neck of those who have suffered foreign exchange credit, not the exchange rate, but the exchange rate at the time of admission, we're gonna settle their situation with a new settlement law. But I also have to tell you that if you were planning to make substantial progress on the subject of migration, you would support Jobbik's proposal that an independent border guard should be assigned to the physical border lock and that you might not have sold bonds to aliens and wealthy migrants who could move into this country with a substantial risk of national security, at least with a right of establishment. But all these questions would make sense if Fidesz had a programme, because Jobbik had a programme, if Fidesz had a vision, because Jobbik had a vision against you, and while you are campaigning on one subject, your prime minister is threatening the opposition with legal and political sanctions, with consequences, while the only possible change of government force, is walking the country along Jobbik's programming points. We're gonna win this election, and I'm not gonna threaten you, and I promise you, once we win the election, we're gonna get the count started. Thank you for the opportunity. [[Let's hear it for Jobbik.]]
u2018-03-21-6	Thank you very much, Congressman. On behalf of the Government, Mr Csaba Dömötör, State Secretary, replied to his speech before the agenda. Here you go, Mr. Secretary. You have the floor.
u2018-03-21-7	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. As far as foreign exchange lenders are concerned, Jobbik also acts differently and says otherwise in this case, because when it came to this decision in Parliament, many politicians like Gábor Vona, along with Gyurcs and the socialists, did not vote for bank accountability and forintation, so if it had been up to you, the banks would have benefited. [[Dr. Pál Völner: That's right!]] With regard to family policy measures, he also referred to this - I would ask you to coordinate with your new ally, LMP, because they would like to abolish the CSOK for new housing, as well as to transform family tax incentives. [[Márta Demeter: Read the program!]] In your programme, Congresswoman, you know as well as I do that there is the expression that this must be put to an end. Please take a look. [[Márta Demeter interrupts.]] I'd like to say one more thing about this, so I'd like you to agree here. Allow me to refer back to an earlier story. Earlier, the socialists organized a hunger march, with their leaders being 100 millionaires, and they did not name it the procession of power hunger for a reason. I'm telling you this because Jobbik has also organized his own hunger for power in recent years. [[There's a grumble in Jobbik's ranks.]] It is not known exactly who is responsible for this, the party president or the party as a whole, but the fact is that from a national party they deliberately organised a party whose soul was so sold that it carried out a complete comparison with the left. [[Intercoms from Jobbik's ranks.]] Thus, the Gyurcsány-Vona pact does not belong in the world of political science fiction at all, and if it were up to these two characters, it would come together, so that the eye-shooters and the former Guardians' colluding will rise into one of the steepest stunts of the last 30 years. [[Z. Carpathian Daniel: What are you talking about? What about the bonds? Answer the questions. Mr. President. Intercoms from Jobbik's ranks.]] Jobbik or the party president's hunger for power is well demonstrated by their smooth cooperation with those previously considered to be their main political rival. For example, you told me earlier about the LMP that with their cheesy, inner-pest politics, they couldn't really kick the ball, and that they couldn't find anything else in their backpack but the chewed-up bones of the SDS. [[Dr. Wind Bernadett: Small visual disturbance.]] That's how you felt about the people you're working with right now. On one occasion Gábor Vona slowly said that everyone should understand that Jobbik does not cooperate with MSZP, LMP. Compared to that, after Jobbik has already been bought [[Z. Carpathian Daniel: Answer the question!]] It is now suspected that the other opposition candidates will be bought out, which is what the steps already announced are about. [[István Szávay: Let us know who we're dealing with.]] If it's proven, it's the worst form of corruption. The total loss of Jobbik's face can also be seen in many other cases. You mentioned the issue of immigration, so I would also like to respond to that. After all, we are in the middle of a serious immigration crisis, and there is pressure in the country, and it is now deciding whether Hungary will be broken. What's the Jobbik doing? He's attacking the government's steps along the way with the left. [[Z. Carpathian Daniel: You deceived the people!]] The main milestones of this are, by the way, well remembered. [[György Szilágyi: We are happy for this thousand people.]] He did not vote in favour of the non-quota constitutional amendment [[Noise, noise, interruptions from Jobbik's ranks. The president's ringing the bell.]] You know as well as I do, they sat here and they didn't vote. The border lock was said to be a failure [[György Szilágyi intervenes.]] and Gábor Vona, to make it worse, thought at a forum in Istanbul about stepping out of the European Union and conspiring with his real brothers, he also said that Islam is his last ray of light. [[György Szilágyi: You lie all the time! You've been lying for three and a half minutes!]] This is what Christian traditions count for those who had crossed the Hungarian cities years ago. Where the Jobbik has arrived, the party spokesperson has a recent statement, interview. He said, and I quote, that we weren't the people we were supposed to be. The rhetoric that went on wasn't true. He went on. [[István Szávay: Let it go! Noise, rumble in the ranks of Jobbik. The president's ringing the bell.]] It is true, honourable right-wing Members, that the guard vest, the circus kitten and the turban triangle are really not easy to find out, that is true. [[Dr. Pál Völner: Actors!]] Either way, it's sad to watch a former national party go down the path of a hunger for power, and on the edge of it are Ágnes Heller, Henrik Havas and Lajos Simicska, but very much, and you should know that at the end of the road there is a small hut with Ferenc Gyurcsány in it. [[An uproar in Jobbik's ranks. Depletion in the lines of the LMP. Dr. Ákos Hadházy applauds. György Szilágyi: Are you all right?]] And you know what? Gábor Vona is probably right. [[The president's ringing the bell.]] This is no longer a right-wing party, nor is it a national party. That's a million of their voters being cheated. [[Intercoms from Jobbik and LMP.]] And believe me, there will be consequences. Thank you for listening. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties. Intruder from Jobbik's ranks: Bravo!]]
u2018-03-21-8	Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Dear fellow Members, [[Towards the opposition side:]] Now, calm down for a minute. [[Dániel Z. Carpathian: It is not easy, Mr President.]] Who, according to the government, have applied for a speech before the agenda entitled 'No', from the Group of the LMP, Ms Bernadett Szél. Here you go, ma'am. You have the floor.
u2018-03-21-9	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear Parliament, I found it rather difficult to control myself, because what you're doing here was a manifestation of old politics. The May Other has initiated an extraordinary parliamentary meeting to solve the Hungarian housing crisis. This is our last chance in this session to make this decision, compared to this, the Fidesz people are not at work, and when they come in, they are also organizing stand-up comedy. It's good that the Secretary of State doesn't want 500 forints in order to listen to this image-compromising monologue he gave here in the previous period. Gentlemen and ladies, There's a housing crisis in this country. They're sitting here with us in this House. [[He's pointing up to the gallery.]] there on the gallery are those affected who struggle to have a roof over their heads, who struggle to have a home for all people in Hungary, not just a home, but a home. I thank you with respect for coming to us and being here with us in the Hungarian Parliament, and I can assure you and all Hungarian citizens that this is not how the Hungarian Parliament will look on an LMP government, and we will end these pathetic snake-frog yellings on each other, because in Hungary, in the Hungarian Parliament, we have to talk about the problems of Hungarian people. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: You should start now.]] We initiated this debate for two reasons. One was the solution to the housing crisis, in order not to fear tens of thousands of Hungarian families, so that three weeks later, after the elections, they trickily drew the border to restart the evictions. Because we shouldn't have illusions, Fidesz and KDNP didn't solve the problem of foreign exchange credentials, they swept it under the carpet until the end of the election. After the elections, if it depends on Fidesen and KDNP, the evictions will start again, and given that György Matolcsy still lives in some 400 million castle, I don't think he'll be able to detect your situation from there. I am talking to all my fellow Hungarian citizens who are in a housing crisis. From that castle, honourable Fidesz secretary of state, the Hungarian reality cannot be seen; it is not what I would like to read to you now, because she is here with us in this House, there on the gallery, the mother who came from Bihari Street, and other families who are threatened with eviction - the single mother who, when the winter eviction moratorium is over, can be evicted from the local government's apartment and from her apartment with her small child, even though they do not have a single HUF debt. After the election, if you remain on the government, he'll have terrible times ahead of him. And there's that four-year-old mother up in the gallery who's struggling to make sure she doesn't lose her present-day, shiny apartment. And here's the family who could settle his backlog, he would have done it, the municipality wouldn't let him, they could end up on the street with the moratorium. I wanted to ask you to talk about the 260 billion forints that a LMP government would give to help foreign exchange lenders in the central bank at György Matolcsy. As long as there is no European court ruling, no one in this country should be molested by foreign exchange credentials, because these people deserve the home and the apartment as well as you or the State Secretarys, or as the President of the Central Bank, for whom I will ask once again and answer this - how do you think that such a person can live in an apartment of 400 million. How dare Lajos Kósa, another fallen minister, cannot account for HUF 1300 billion? ! There's the other minister, Antal Rogán, with his helicoptering, there's Zsolt Semjén, who's been helicoptering on deer hunting. What's this? How does this work, gentlemen? ! [[13.30]] There is no Viktor Orbán here, who is the leader of the whole place, who can [[Dániel Z. Kárpát: He is hunting Hornast.]] In order to punish us, everyone, opposition politicians and opposition representatives, on 15 March, at our national holiday, that he will take our revenge. These people will take satisfaction from you, because these people have been waiting for years to have housing, so that their children can buy a winter shoe, so that you don't give it to me, God, the family can go on vacation to Lake Balaton for a week in the summer, these people will take satisfaction from you, and for that, we need to vote enough on 8 April. It's a shame and a shame that you come in here with your pre-written papers, and you don't talk about the agent files, even though you, Mr. Secretary, know exactly that your election promise was to have the publicity of lustration and agent files in this country. How many people are they hiding? Károly Sita's been compromised. You got caught hiding him, too. But how many of you were here in the Hungarian Parliament with an agent's past? ! [[Interview from the LMP lines: There were, there were more.]] I'm sure it was because they're not at work right now, although I don't know exactly who they're working for, because anyone with an agent's past is extortionable. Therefore, I can assure the entire country in the LMP government that there will be no failed agents, because we will do what the Fidesz promised and did not do: the publicity of the agent files and the total frustration. Vote for LMP on 8 April [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Time's up!]] Because we keep our word. We've been keeping our word, talking about the housing crisis, while you guys were talking shit to each other. [[Sallai R. Benedict: That's right! Applause in the lines of the LMP.]]
u2018-03-21-10	Thank you very much, Madam Group leader. I'll ask the Secretary of State. [[For signal:]] State Secretary Bence Rétvári will respond to the statement made before the agenda by the Head of the Group. Here you go, Mr. Secretary. You have the floor.
u2018-03-21-11	Thank you very much for the floor, Mr President. Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear House, You said to end the old policy of spending your Sunday at Ferenc Gyurcsány's and agreed there. So you would end old politics by going to Gyurcsány, consulting with him, coordinating with him [[Dr. István Józsa: That was the Cutter, you!]] And then there's press conferences. I don't know if it's possible to renew Hungarian politics from the cave of Ferenc Gyurcsány, but I think that's unlikely, and I think with that LMP is also... [[The president's ringing the bell. Dr. Wind Bernadett stands up and points to the gallery: What about the housing crisis? Don't get me wrong. Tell me what you want to say to these people up there. Tell them.]] With what you started, Madam Group leader, I will begin with and continue with what you have done, if you have the patience to wait for the answer here in Parliament. So you came out of Ferenc Gyurcsány's cave and announced the new policy, which is quite a credibility crisis. What would the government do, and what would the LMP do? Let's see what LMP hasn't done for the people who are friends of the people who sit up in the gallery! The LMP did not support the introduction of a price barrier. The LMP did not support the introduction of the option of end-payment. [[Interjection from Jobbik's ranks: Not on the LMP ex-government!]] LMP did not support the vote of the National Asset Manager. [[Dr. Wind Bernadett: Dr. János Fónagy: That's right! That's right!]] Hundreds of thousands of people have been let down by Possibly Other Politics [[Dr. Wind Bernadett: He's lying!]] 'Cause the small-time political opposition [[Z. Carpathian Daniel: Speak of yourselves!]] more important to him [[Dr. Wind Bernadett: How long will there be an eviction moratorium?]] as it is in the interest of any creditor, and only because it is a pro-government Fidesz-KDNP proposal, it has been voted down instead of supporting it. [[Intruder from Fidesz: That's right!]] If I look only at the National Asset Manager, honourable Member, which you have not supported, [[Z. Kárpát Dániel: Bank Alliance Pact! EBRD pact!]] 41,960 offers were accepted, and 34,000 were already in financial management. With this, the National Asset Manager was able to help 150,000 people like the people who were sitting up there, so they wouldn't get on the street, but in the apartment they used to live in. [[Dr. Wind Bernadett: Tell that to the people in the gallery. Z. Kárpát, Dániel: Don't say that in a residential forum, because they're putting you in their pockets!]] I want them there as tenants. Do you know how much rent these people have to pay on average today? 10 905 forints in total. On average, a hundred applications continue every day, because we can help an average of 100 people a day in the construction that you LMP people did not vote for. Since the launch, we have used HUF 133 billion of budget resources, and from this we have generated 314 billion forints of loan and tax debt. So we can talk about hundreds of thousands of people who have been able to escape from being homeless, not having a home, not having a home, and not having any of these. [[Dr. Wind Bernadett: What do you say to the gallery?]] But you've already told me what LMP's own housing policy is. You would eliminate the $10 plus $10 million CSOK grant. [[Dr. Wind Bernadett: That's not true!]] that those families, those families with three children... [[Dr. Ákos Hadházy is on his way to Dr. Bence Rétvári.]] Congressman, I'd like you to stay where you are. Mr. President... [[Dr. Ákos Hadházy steps behind Dr. Bence Rétvári, and during the entire time of his reply, a lie lies at the end, because he holds a sign with half a sign in his hand, while Dr. Pál Völner speaks to him quietly. Dr. János Fónagy: Clown! Clown! Clown! Clown! Noise.]]

u2018-03-21-19	You're going to Lajos Simicska's, before that you went to the LMP, you used to have fidesz.
u2018-03-21-20	Mr. Secretary.
u2018-03-21-21	You've done everything, Congressman. In your place, please hear me out.
u2018-03-21-22	Mr. Secretary. Do not engage in a separate partial discussion with Congressman Hadházy, but continue. You have the floor, of course I'll count on it. I will also inform Mr President of the disturbance that Congressman Hadházy has often done as usual. There you go. Keep going.
u2018-03-21-23	Congressman Hadházy respects so much those people who are sitting here on the gallery and who are really struggling with a housing crisis to use this entire speech to perform with their own group leader. [[Dániel Z. Carpathian: Sure, we're clowning!]] He is not trying to solve people's problems, he is trying to gain a moment's fame, and he is not interested in the least of the people who are dealing with a housing crisis today. Ladies and gentlemen, In recent years, Fidesz-KDNP has been responsible for the fact that, in order to prevent the housing crisis, countless people have been able to get rid of the accumulated debt owed by the former MSZP-SZDSZ government through the reduction of the rent. [[Dr. Wind Bernadett: You don't even go to work.]] He must have been stockpiling or in such a situation because of his fees raised in the stars. Without a reduction in the number of people [[István Szávay: You've lied enough, sit down.]] There'd be a lot more people in the housing crisis today. For families, it is a huge result and a huge discount that 740 thousand more people can now spend on their housing on wages and are not subject to aid. Eight years ago, you mocked and laughed at us when we said that we were creating a million new jobs in Hungary. In eight years we have created 740,000 new jobs [[Z. Carpathian Daniel: It's not true!]] There are 740,000 fewer families exposed. [[István Szávay: You're lying! You're lying again! Intercoms from Jobbik: There's a sign behind you! Dr. Wind Bernadett: Butcher has a new job! Szabolcs Szabó: You also counted the workers working abroad!]] the housing crisis, the Hungarian people today earn 60 percent more than they did eight years ago. Sure, let's do the LMP. You will be able to raise the taxes you are about to do, not only to abolish the CSOK, but also to introduce higher personal income tax rates among the personal income tax rates, which will take away from people. [[Dr. Wind Bernadett: The Secretary of State fears your salary.]] This growth. You will take away with this extra tax burden that you impose, and indeed these tax reductions and these increases will stop if your classic red proposals can be introduced by LMP here. [[Noise.]] [[Noise.]] I think so. I believe that opposition parties' proposals could put family tax relief at great risk. [[The president, by jogging the bell, indicates the end of the time.]] Here, too, we have very dangerous proposals for the opposition. [[Intercoms from Jobbik: Six minutes was enough!]] Finally, I'd just like to say [[Intercoms from Jobbik, among them: It was very good. Excellent, thank you.]] Ladies and gentlemen, in recent years, 900,000 people have been helped by the job protection action [[Noise. Intercoms from Jobbik, among them: Sit down! Stop it! Time's up!]] to help you keep your job. [[Let's hear it for Jobbik. Noise. The president's ringing the bell.]] If these people didn't have jobs today, they'd be more exposed to a real housing crisis. [[Interview from Jobbik's ranks: Sit down, Number One.]] The most important way to prevent the housing crisis is for Fidesz-KDNP to continue to govern after 8 April. [[Z. Carpathian Daniel: Let's not joke.]] Thank you for listening. [[Applause from the pro-government benches.]]
u2018-03-21-24	Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. [[Dr. Ákos Hadházy returns to his seat. Dr. Pál Völner: Why don't you stay? Dr. János Fónagy: Scandalist! Clown! Dr. Bence Rétvári: That's all you know! That's all you are!]] Congressman Hadházy, hate is a bad counselor, believe me. Dear Parliament, Mr Gulyás Gergely, Head of the Group of the Fidesz Group, entitled "Our current affairs" has applied for a speech before the agenda. Mr. Team Leader, you have the floor, please.
u2018-03-21-25	Mr President, First of all, allow me, Mr President and Honourable Parliament, to comment on [[Dr. Wind Bernadett: Fidesz didn't show up for work.]] The fact that Jobbik and the LMP's faction, based on their behaviour over the last 25 minutes, are not only unfit for pro-government or government work, but they are not able to behave normally compared to the custom they have had in Parliament in the last 28 years. [[Applause from the pro-government benches. Big noise, interruptions, including Szabolcs Szabó: At least they come to work! A statement from the benches of the MSZP: "Whoever doesn't come in?" Dr. Bence Rétvári: Where is Gábor Vona? Szabolcs Szabó: You have to go to work! Dr. Bence Rétvári: Gábor Vona works?]] [[13.40]] No doubt this house competition between Jobbik and LMP was won by the LMP, because they even got a clown into Parliament. [[Szabolcs Szabó: Work is not a domestic competition, but money is paid for it!]] who holds a sign behind the Secretary of State [[Dr. István Józsa: Lajos Kósa!]] the content of which only qualifies as his political, otherwise extremely colourful, political activity. [[György Szilágyi: How offended you are! You're being very insulting. Z. Carpathian Daniel: Shame on you!]]
u2018-03-21-26	Mr. Director, with all due respect, I'd like to ask you to [[Dr. Gergely Gulyás: Which, on the other hand...]] Says before the agenda. Thank you very much.
u2018-03-21-27	However, what concerns the current initiative may be that the quiet that the Socialist Party has experienced so far is due to the fact that they, after all, have faced the fact that it is very difficult not to consider it impertinent that today an initiative for an extraordinary meeting is being signed to introduce a 13th month pension. [[Dr. István Józsa: Who introduced me! We brought him in!]] who voted to put an end to this. [[It's a lot of noise. Dr. László Kács: You voted him down!]] Who voted in favour of the 13th month pension, who abolished it [[Dr. László Kács: Exactly, we introduced it!]] I would like to say exactly: Sándor Burány, Zoltán Gőgös, Ferenc Gyurcsány, István Józsa, Lajos Korózs, Zoltán Lukács, Attila Mesterházy, Dr. Lajos Oláh, József Tobias, Ágnes Vadai, László Varju and Gábor Fodor. They were the ones who voted in favour of the abolition of the 13th month pension [[Dr. István Józsa: We introduced it!]] And now they're taking the initiative here two weeks before the election. [[The president's ringing the bell.]] It is very difficult to imagine a more brazen and transparent political action. We also clearly see that, in these cases, the opposition has initiated a meeting not because it wants to take care of anything, but that it wants to take advantage of the possibility of political hystericalisation here. It is a pity that, in the absence of any interest, they are not using their own forums and election meetings, but the publicity of the Parliament. All of this by being grossly insulted by their behavior, by the way. [[Dániel Z. Carpathian: You can go to work!]] the dignity of the Parliament. We also see that if we want to talk about important issues, we cannot go without saying that, according to today's newspaper article, on the third day in a row, this is the third exposing article - the threats to Hungary's sovereignty. What makes it clear is that György Soros is the leader of an organization [[Ildikó Bangóné Borbély: Half the Fidesz fraction studied there!]] There are more than two thousand representatives working here in Hungary to overthrow the Orbán government, to enforce the billionaire's financial interests [[Dániel Z. Carpathian: How many of these scholarships do you have?]] and, moreover, in order to obtain financial benefits. This, I think, is a very serious matter. That's two thousand activists if they're not in your ranks yet. [[Ildikó Bangóné Borbély: There they sit!]] The stakes of the elections are that if the opposition came to power, many of them would be sitting in the benches of Parliament. It is not my duty to discuss the relations between opposition parties for a long time, but even Balliberian parties and LMP. [[Adam Mirkóczki: Talk about yourselves!]] How could he cooperate with each other if the only public news about their coordination was that the former Prime Minister was drunk or not drunk. The only serious news of your discussion in the press was this. Do you want to cooperate with each other? Do you want to form a government in Hungary? In recent years Jobbik has produced a turnaround that is unique in Hungarian politics. [[György Szilágyi: Think of yours!]] Now the Jobbik who previously protested at the National Theatre [[István Szávay: Your buddy already told me!]] He was a lobbyist for Robert of Alföldi. After an otherwise fair, objective presentation of the effects of migration in the Lazarus video [[Defiance from the Jobbik benches.]] Are you apologizing to the Viennese? Do you apologize to the Viennese, whose sympathizers handed out pepper spray in Vienna two years ago, so that you think the Viennese can protect themselves from migrants? You're the ones in your election programme in 2014 that have to be classified as an agent organisation for organisations supported from abroad [[Dániel Z. Carpathian: What was in your election program?]] It is you who have turned to the Constitutional Court on a law far more subtle and transparent than that. [[Ádám Mirkóczki: COF would be the first agent!]] I just want to say that Ferenc Gyurcsány rarely speaks the truth. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Alcohol helps him!]] On the one hand, however, your political perception is accurate: your cooperation, which can now extend from Jobbik to Ferenc Gyurcsány, [[Adam Mirkóczki: You are petty thieves!]] It would bring chaos to the country. Instead, I suggest we protect the country's security. [[Dániel Z. Carpathian: You didn't say a word about yourselves.]] and preserve the results that the country has achieved over the last eight years. [[Dr. István Józsa: Lajos Kósa's money!]] Thank you for your attention. [[A round of applause from the benches of the governing parties.]]
u2018-03-21-28	Thank you very much, Mr. Group Leader. On behalf of the Government, Mr Csaba Dömötör, State Secretary, responds to his speech before the agenda. [[Ádám Mirkóczki: There was no question, no need to answer!]] Here you go, Mr. Secretary. You have the floor.
u2018-03-21-29	Mr President, Dear Chief of Staff, You referred to it, and it is true that what we see now is an unprecedented attempt to intervene in the course of the Hungarian elections. [[István Szávay: Dear God!]] An extensive network is working to bring a country to its knees. [[Szabolcs Szabó: Chemtrail! Adam Mirkóczki: CÖF and Fidesz!]] which stands up for itself and does not want to be turned into an immigrant country. The attempts to intervene take many forms [[Adam Mirkóczki: NASA intervenes!]] They want to break Hungary with financial blackmail, legal instruments, thousands of paid people, fake news and embarrassing campaigns. If there's a laugh between you two [[Ildikó Bangóné Borbély: Laughter, Minister of State!]] Your time, your arrival, you may well ask the question, "What is the reason for this?" This is because now they want to finalise the plans that would perpetuate immigration in Europe; plans that would virtually take the right from the hands of the nation states to whom they let in and who they live with. [[Adam Mirkóczki: With the reindeer!]] These plans stand in the way of Hungary, as do the Visegrád countries. Indeed, the magnitude of the intervention experiments is well indicated [[Adam Mirkóczki: The reindeer and the polar bears are coming!]] According to today's press reports, one of George Soros' main men was talking about it. [[István Szávay: Talk about the lizards too!]] Two thousand of their people are working against the Hungarian Prime Minister. As regards the legal procedures and the specifics, the topicalities, the EU institutions want to finalise the resettlement quota programme now. [[Márta Demeter: Talk about settlement bonds!]] This has been sent, and there is also a written proposal on it, a compromise proposal from the Bulgarian EU Presidency [[A statement from the opposition benches: You have introduced it! Dr. László Kács: You have accepted 1300!]] which, however, was not actually a compromise proposal, but a dictatorship. This can also be seen from the fact that the Belgian Prime Minister sent a clear message in an interview [[Dr. László Kács: You bowed before him!]] that they have made an ultimatum for the Visegrád countries, and will decide without them if necessary. [[György Szilágyi: But you have already fulfilled your quota!]] the introductions. It is good to know that the European Commission wants a mandatory quota, and the European Parliament has voted on this. [[István Szávay: You let 1300 in!]] On 16 November, the Hungarian Socialist Party also supported the quota, and the LMP also supported the quota, look at it. [[Dr. László Kács: That notary Lajos Kósa had it! He's busy. Attila Mesterházy: Talk about the 1291 settled and the settlement bond holders.]] the statement made by their representative, so the fact is that the pro-quotaers should only pass through the Council. In the meantime, a migration agreement is being negotiated at the UN [[A statement from the benches of the MSZP, and you took them in.]] The main danger of which is that it considers migration and establishment as fundamental rights. If this is accepted, this could be a reference for other international organisations in the future. [[Attila Mesterházy: You've installed 1291 immigrants!]] That alone is reason enough to reject this. Where introductions have already been carried out, this has otherwise resulted in tragic consequences. In Italy, there are unused barracks where thousands of immigrants live. In France, they wanted to use official means to distribute the crowded immigrants in Calais by overwriting local protests. Local government housing contracts are being opened in Germany because immigrants need a place to live. Only Munich, I would also like to tell the opposition representatives [[Adam Mirkóczki: Only Bayern Munich!]] Munich alone had to take in 24,000 immigrants [[Bangóné Borbély Ildikó: 1300!]] In one year. I am also bringing up international alarming examples for you because the opposition parties, the situation, have concrete plans for how to implement resettlements. [[Dr. László Kács: You have already done it!]] The party of Gergely Christmas, who is currently the candidate for Prime Minister of the MSZP, has made it clear that unused barracks should be opened. [[Ildikó Bangóné Borbély: Here we go again!]] As I have already pointed out, this example already exists in Italy, with tragic consequences. One activist group funded from abroad also suggested that this be extended to schools and kindergartens. If we add to this that the opposition is practically united in the fact that the border closure should be dismantled, even though it is denied now, it is quite a terrible overall picture. In these circumstances, we can really say that if someone counts on the security of the country, if someone wants to take action against illegal immigration, they can only count on the government and the governing parties. We will act with all means against attempts to intervene abroad, and we will not let them turn Hungary into an immigrant country. This is the main stakes of the April 8th election. [[Attila Mesterházy: Why did you let the migrants in?]] We've never been this close to having more independence, more independence, more prosperity in our own hands. But the prerequisite for this is that Hungary cannot be an immigrant country. [[István Szávay: No!]] What is this, if not the ideal of civil Hungary? We're not gonna let them take that away from us. Thank you for listening. [[Márta Demeter: You will answer before a court of law! Applause from the pro-government benches.]] [[13.50]]
u2018-03-21-30	Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Dear Parliament, This brings us to the end of the speeches before the agenda. I would like to inform you that no one has applied for a post-scheduled speech, and before we go any further, there is now an opportunity to welcome one Benedict of Parliament on his name day. Happy birthday. Dear Parliament, The District Court of Miskolc has proposed the suspension of the immunity of our betterman, Zsolt Egyed. I would like to ask Mr László Földi to present the document and the related measure. Here you go, notary.
u2018-03-21-31	Dear Parliament, XXXVI of 2012 on the National Assembly Law 77. In accordance with § (1) of the Miskolc District Court 8.Bpk.75/2018/4. Mr. Zsolt Egyed, Jobbik, Member of Parliament, filed a motion to suspend his immunity in private proceedings. I handed this over to the immunity committee for examination. The Committee concluded that the complaint was based on the speech of the Parliament during its plenary session in the context of the mandate of the parliamentary representatives of Zsolt Egyed. Ogytv. 73. The representatives of the Member may not be held liable before a court for the fact or opinion he has communicated in connection with the mandate of his or her representatives in connection with the exercise of his or her mandate. The President of the Miskolc District Court has been informed of this by the President of the Committee by the simultaneous return of the documents.
u2018-03-21-32	Thank you very much, Mr. Notary. Dear Parliament, I would now like to ask Mr Dezső Szigély to present a submission on the initiative of our meeting today. Here you go, notary. You have the floor.
u2018-03-21-33	Dear Parliament, I declare that 43 Members are members of the Parliament Act 35. According to § (1) of the Act, the Parliament initiated the convening of an extraordinary meeting of the T/2012.4 on certain amendments to the laws necessary to prevent the homelessness of families with children. T/19984 on the transparency of the state security past and amendments to the laws necessary to exclude the professional staff of pro-state leaders and dictatorship from the possession of certain public offices.

u2018-03-21-34	Thank you very much, Mr. Notary. Ladies and gentlemen, It's 13:54. We are now deciding on a proposal on the agenda put forward by the President. I ask the Honourable Parliament whether it accepts the recommendation on the agenda. Please vote by raising your hands. [[Vote.]] You can see that Parliament is not capable of a resolution, so I can tell from here. I respectfully declare that Mr Gergely Gulyás, Head of the Group, initiated the re-run of the vote using a ballot counting machine in a letter before the beginning of the meeting. In accordance with the motion, I am now asking the Honourable Parliament whether it will accept the proposal on the agenda put forward by the President. Please vote by using your ballot counting machine. [[Vote.]] Thank you very much. I note that, when the agenda was adopted, the Parliament decided by 29 votes in favour, no votes against and no abstentions. These 29 votes are not sufficient for the Parliament to make a valid decision because it is not a quorum. Accordingly, the house rules are 14. § 2 of the Rules provides that I will establish the list of Members who are missing from today's sitting, and, in the absence of a proposal on the agenda adopted on the basis of the provisions of the House Rules, no item of the agenda may be discussed. Thank you for your work. I wish you all a good day, the meeting is closed.
