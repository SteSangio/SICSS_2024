u2019-07-12-0	[[The people in this room stand up and greet the voters' community. When the chairman of the meeting takes his seat, the people in the room will sit down.]] Dear Parliament, The Fifth Special Meeting of the Parliament is hereby opened. I would like to inform you that István Tiba and György Szi-lágyi will be in charge of the meeting. Welcome to our guests and to all those who monitor our work. Dear Parliament, I declare that Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjén, on behalf of the Government, is the XXXVI of 2012 on Parliament. Law 35. On 12 July 2019 the Parliament initiated an extraordinary meeting on the basis of Article 1 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The motion and its annex can be found on the website by Members and interested parties. Dear Parliament, We will continue our work with speeches before the agenda. Before the agenda, Mr Lajos Korózs, from the MSZP Group, asked for a speech entitled "On Current Affairs." You have the floor, Congressman.
u2019-07-12-1	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear House, Dear fellow Members, There are things that work in this country, and there are things that don't work. It doesn't work because that's what I'd do with the police. The police don't work because there are awfully few cops, there's a lot of fluctuations, and as a result, the police have a lot of overtime, but they don't pay their overtime. [[Károly Kontra: It's not true!]] Health care doesn't work because there's too few doctors, not enough health professionals. In the days it was read that they now earn twice or three times as much in Romania. [[István Szilárd Németh: Stop talking nonsense, please!]] Doctors and health professionals, as in Hungary; this suggests the possibility that doctors will no longer go to work in England and Germany, but soon to Romania. At the same time, we also see that there is a terrible shortage of doctors in primary care, according to the latest statistics 373 permanently unfilled GP practice in Hungary and 243 dental practice. Practically there are hardly any general practitioners in Hungary in the middle of the Danube-Tisza. Dear Friends! You can predict that in a year or two, a million people in the country won't have a home doctor. Education doesn't work, because there are terribly few teachers, terribly few kindergarten teachers, and extremely little salary; it's natural for them to leave the field and not want to work in their profession. In addition, according to the latest figures, there are 340 thousand young people between 18 and 35 years of age who neither study nor work, nor vocational training or practical training, and 20 percent of these young Hungarians are not taking part. The fire department doesn't work because the firefighters don't pay or pay as much as they give, so they refuse to do their job. I can advise everyone to keep at least a bucket of water at home if there's a problem, because the fireman is sure he won't make it. And the government office doesn't work, the government's sub-schemes don't work, because simply people don't get enough pay, and they quit their jobs, and some of them got laid off. Tell me, fellow Members, only one area, any segment of public administration where things work. Then, of course, we have to talk about where things work: for example, sewage sludge comes to the country unchanged for tons, 52,000 tons of it I mentioned here last week in a series of interpellations only from Croatia. This mud comes so far that, please, they have applied for an extension permit in Székesfehérvár, and I also told them that I did not know by hearing that I was there, photographed it, filmed it, please, pouring such a thin fecality into the clay mine, near the apartments, or the shopping mall, that it is better than the Padlopon socket leveller. [[Defiance in Jobbik's ranks.]] And don't tell me it's a pre-treated compostable sewage sludge. And the same is the case in Pope, where a large amount of sewage sludge was also taken, and the distributor, or whoever is doing all this, says that they will defend themselves against the stench by building hedges. Well, I'll pay you extra. And here it is, please, in my hand is the government official document, where it is classified for five pages, that in Egerszalok, where they also want to create such a sludge dump, what they have to do with it. The office lists on five pages what they need to present. I ask you: who will allow 200,000 tons of sewage sludge from Italy to be planted in the middle of the wine region? And, my dear friends, today you can see the mud poured into the Gyal River, on YouTube, everyone could see that fields are being watered with fecal water. I'll ask you, either the President or the ministers of state, gentlemen, would you like to buy some of the Vecsis cabbage sour that is watered with the water of the fecal creek? Would you guys buy a head cabbage for a cabbage twig that's watered with such contaminated water? I don't think anyone did. Thank you very much.
u2019-07-12-2	Thank you. Dear Parliament, On behalf of the Government, Parliamentary Secretary Bence Rétvári wishes to respond to what has been said. You have the floor, Mr. Secretary.
u2019-07-12-3	Thank you very much for the floor, Mr President. Honourable Congressman, Dear House, I think the only thing that bothers you, honourable Member, is the Hungarian Socialist Party, which does not work in this country. After all, you spoke from a faction of a party whose political year-end speech is not spoken by the group leader; you are the representative of a party that has ever achieved results above 90% before the 1990s in the mid-1990s, but this is another chapter, but even in the democratic era, they have achieved results of far over 30 percent, and now they have fallen back to the entry threshold. [[Peter Ungár intervenes.]] , with a score of around 6,6 percent. This is the non-operation that bothers you very much. Some people put it a little differently: your former captain, vice president, Tibor Szanyi:. This is not a party! So it's just a degenerate, indoor club, where the political set of topics has dried up, and we're chasing around here and there for the little crooks. So your speech, as your own party partner or, I don't know, your ex-partner, was such a scratch, because recently the disbarment was not only at the LMP, but also at the MSZP; well, it was still heard from you. [[10.10]] The reason why the MSZP is a failure or a failure is because you can't even afford a candidate for mayor. [[Peter Ungár intervenes.]] They supported Gábor Demszky, who was the candidate for mayor of SZDSZ, and then they had a candidate outside Ferenc Falus, and then they had a political candidate in another party, Lajos Bokros, and they still don't, 30 years after the change of regime, they can't present a candidate for mayor, but they also support Gergely Christmas, the failed politician of dialogue in Zugló, which can't be accused of widespread support. Mr President, this is a rather large proof of non-functioning, and what you are doing here in Parliament is proof of frivolity and incompetence. Honourable Congressman, You were talking about doctors leaving. This was true in a huge number of areas around 2010 and 11 but since then the number of doctors seeking permission to work abroad has fallen by 60 to 70 percent. This figure has fallen to one third and has also decreased significantly among nurses. You were talking about education and students. Honourable Congressman, In your time, a Hungarian educator had about 11.5 students, and now less than 10.5 students. In Hungarian: much more attention can be paid to a student today, precisely because on the one hand we did not continue your school closing efforts. You've closed the school in hundreds of jobs, we've kept the schools, we've hired teachers, we've got Klebelsberg scholarships to encourage young people to choose the teaching field. Luckily, 30 percent more people choose, so now a student gets more attention, as a teacher has fewer students to deal with. Not to mention, honourable Member, that we have also rejected the model that is based on mass immigration, as schools in Western Europe, besides the educational function, now have an increasingly socialization function to try to reconcile young people from different cultures, and that is why German science education has dropped more than a dozen places in international rankings, for example, according to recent measurements. You said, honourable Member, and this is also a self-revealing of frivolity and incompetence that too many students leave school without a degree. Today, we are going to vote on the National Public Education Act, one of the amendments to which is precisely to avoid pushing troubled children out of the school system, to say that they are home-schooled, but they are actually getting rid of them, and no school is going to take care of them, and that young person is not getting an education. If what you said is really important to you, and you really want to take action to get a degree and not get out without a degree, then support today the amendment of the Education Act, the National Public Education Act. And as far as the allowances are concerned, honourable Member, do you speak of unpaid allowances? One of the first tasks of this government in 2010 was to pay the firefighters an unpaid payment of HUF 7 billion. [[Péter Cseresnyés: For example!]] which you didn't pay under your own government. Not only have wages been cut across the public sector for doctors, nurses and teachers, firefighters, but they haven't even paid their allowances and you're talking about it? ! How many steering windows were there in your time? There weren't any, Congressman. In your time, how many students went to Elizabeth camps this summer? None. Now 130,000. How much were they planning for a baby's meal? 29 billion. We're 82. Was it a free textbook? No, it wasn't. Instead of 800,000 jobs, what did you do? They've doubled unemployment. Not to mention that there was no CSOK or baby shower support, and even a large part of the opposition did not support the baby shower here in Parliament. The opposition is frivolous and incompetent. Thank you very much. [[A round of applause from the benches of the governing parties.]]
u2019-07-12-4	I thank you, Mr Secretary of State, for your reply. Dear Parliament, Péter Ungár, Member of the LMP Group, applied for a pre-meeting speech: Why hasn't the social pay table been settled for years? It's an address. You have the floor, Congressman.
u2019-07-12-5	Thank you for the floor. Mr President, basically, I would like to start by saying that, in my view, the political right and, for example, the LMP are distinguished by what is the welfare state under Article XX. We consider it to be one of the greatest inventions of the century, and we believe that one of the fundamental aims of governance is to maintain or extend the welfare state. For 30 years there has been a bad neoliberal consensus in this House, which says the state is always a bad farmer, the market is always right, and taxation is a bad thing. On the other hand, we believe that the state can be a good farmer, that people like me, who are rich, must be taxed, and that from this, redistribution must be financed, and a higher proportion of which is basically a good thing. The current budget shows that the government is pursuing a neoliberal right-wing policy, as it does not spend enough on the services of the welfare state, but the single-key tax is the basis for the Hungarian economy. [[Nacsa Lőrinc: So a tax increase!]] The fact is that caregivers are not important to the Hungarian government at the moment because caregivers are not a German multi, to which they give tax relief, not the Polish coal industry, which is why they veto the climate plan, and there are no major European nation states behind the caring work, who can give you political positions. The fact is that we are talking about 4-5 thousand people, who are currently caring for their older relatives, siblings or mates at home, who receive 38 and 58 thousand forints for this work, and we are talking about the people, tens of thousands of Hungarian citizens, who are working in social institutions. They are not treated as partners by this government, they do not consult with multinationals, they do not mean as much as Audi, BMW or Suzuki. The fact is that there are a lot of workers in the institutions close to retirement age, a lot of people who have left their careers in Hungary, and a lot of people who commute to Western Europe do this work. Today, the situation in Hungary is that if a nurse goes to a social institution on the western border, an institution in Austria, she will earn more than the head of the institution from which she started. That is the case today in the area of social work. The fact is, there is also a philosophical difference between the government and us in terms of elderly care. You think that caring for the elderly is basically a family task. On the other hand, we believe that it is not an individual, not a family, but a community task, it is a common task for all of us, the task of this House, and therefore a public task. That's the philosophical difference between us. That is why we believe that there is no way to distinguish between home caregivers and older relatives, brothers, and home caregivers. It is not a natural way of life to fall out of the labour market at the end of one's life because of the need to care for older relatives. The fact is that the economy builds on this free care work, which is the basis of the primary labour market, which is the basis for people's participation in employment. Neither the environment nor this kind of caring unpaid work can be seen as a renewable resource, from which there is always more and more of it, which is inexhaustible and which is always getting more and more. If we do not continue to pay for this work, which we have not paid for because of the structure of the economy, then we will have serious economic organisation problems. The fact is that despite the fact that Mr Rétvári, State Secretary, is going to say the increases that are essentially due to the guaranteed minimum wage in the social sector, there are very few social workers who would earn significantly above the guaranteed minimum wage even with a professional degree. This is untenable, this sector is going to collapse, and now you have the opportunity to give a significant wage increase to the people who work in the social sector. The second is that, as there are more and more elderly people in Hungary, and in the future we will spend more and more time in worse health, they cannot afford to pay 38 and 58 thousand forints permanently in Hungary because they fall out of the labour market. Sooner or later, they're gonna have to change that. Don't wait as long as you do with your weed system, don't wait six months, do it as soon as possible, because it's in our mutual interest. Thank you very much.
u2019-07-12-6	Thank you, Congressman. Dear Parliament, On behalf of the Government, Secretary of State Bence Rétvári responds to what has been said. You have the floor, Mr. Secretary. [[10.20]]
u2019-07-12-7	Thank you very much for the floor, Mr President. Honourable Congressman, Dear House, You were at least one of the opposition politicians in the last session, honourable Member, who at least apologized to his own voters about the policy and the result they had achieved in the elections to the European Parliament. [[Zsolt Gréczy: How was KDNP?]] I do not know whether the result of this is that the opposition parties will merge here in front of us, and they will unite under the flag of Ferenc Gyurcsány, but it was undoubtedly depressing to see that the LMP, which was once worth a better fate, graduated from the European Parliament elections behind the Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party. [[Péter Ungár: If you are very worried, you can enter! Zsolt Gréczy: Was ist das KDNP?]] At the same time, I would also argue with you, honourable Member, about the dangers to the welfare state. If you look at the position of the middle class in Western Europe, which is a bastion of the welfare state, you will see that the middle class positions and the narrowing of the middle class have been expanded in Hungary in the last eight to nine years, in Western Europe, the security of the middle class is precisely caused by immigration, because the subsidies you talk about, for example, which in Western Europe, based on your left-wing philosophy, mean the security of the middle class, that there are social aids that, in the event of a temporary problem, can keep someone in the middle class, these subsidies are taken away, and the work is overtaxed, precisely to generate the costs of migration. It is immigration that threatens the middle class, because on the one hand it is breaking public order in society, obviously it is breaking society. As I said earlier in my speech, it turns the education system from education, quasi-engineering in Germany, into a social reconciliation institution, into a place for the acquisition of basic sociocultural skills. Therefore, immigration, migration is the greatest threat to the welfare state you have mentioned and to the middle class in the European Union. We cannot agree with what you have said, honourable Member, and what your proposals for amending the budget say, and what Erzsébet Schmuck's fellow Member and others have said, because you say that the higher the taxes, the better. [[Péter Ungár: He misses rich people! Tax me.]] We disagree. People's work is not subject to very high taxes, people need to be encouraged to work. Socialists had the philosophy of taxing the work to death and living on welfare or being officially on welfare and getting paid blackly; we do not want this world. There are 800,000 new jobs in Hungary because taxes are getting lower, it is becoming easier to employ someone, less administration and less tax is being paid. If you have an average income, and you have three children next to you, you don't pay taxes because of the family tax reduction. More than 100,000, about 130,000 Hungarian families don't pay a penny tax and a penny contribution. Our goal is to reduce taxes, which is why we will work, as we have done in previous years. In particular, in the area of personal income tax reduction, we do not agree with the LMP that we need high taxes and we need an increase in wages. You have fought for this, and this is what your proposals for amending the budget are about. We think it is a dangerous course, and it has a bad message for society as a whole. Honourable Congressman, I can tell you, with regard to the social sphere, that wages in the social sector increased on average by 72 percent by 2019 compared to 2010. In 2014, we introduced a sectoral wage supplement, with a surplus of HUF 12 billion, and since then it has been built in every year. In 2015, we introduced a supplementary allowance and a salary supplement for the workers in the profession; the former was awarded to 90,000 employees and the latter to 66,000 employees. The latter, the 2015 increase was an average of HUF 16 thousand, resulted in a surplus of HUF 16 billion, and we added an additional HUF 9 billion increase to the number of employees in the social sphere in 2017 as a sector's combined bonus; this affected 14 thousand people. So there was also a general, equal and experience-related wage increase in the form of a wage supplement and a wage supplement. Who, say, has a high-school degree in child care and has been working on the field for a long time, is earning more than HUF 116 thousand, who is a college graduate family carer, in his case the salary surplus has been HUF 118 thousand in the last five years. Of course, everyone wants more, we'll be working on it, but these are tangible increases compared to the wage cuts for your allies. And as for the home care fee, the home care fee, honourable Member, we have often said that you did not support it here on 12 December. [[Péter Ungár: Four times since then... the president is ringing the bell.]] He had no time to raise the parents' home care fee to 100,000 forints this year, taking care of their children and raising it to the level of the minimum wage until 2022. [[The President shall ring a bell to indicate the expiry of the time limit.]] You, on the opposition side, did not vote for this, but instead you were honking, beeping, and self-fingering. Thank you very much. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties. Németh Szilárd István: That's right!]]
u2019-07-12-8	Thank you very much, Mr Secretary of State, for your reply. Dear Parliament, Before the agenda, Mr.Péter Jakab, leader of the Group, Jobbik Group, asked for a pre-scheduled speech. It's an address. You have the floor, Congressman.
u2019-07-12-9	Thank you for the floor. Mr President, Dear House, Every year Jobbik makes hundreds of amendments to the budget so that the government does not spend 50 billion a year on posters, for example, but a lot more money on hospitals, schools, wages or pensions. This year we put 555 amendments on the table, one of which was personally thrown back by László Kövér, saying that it violates the authority of the House. In this motion, I suggested that we build an Orbán statue on Felcsút; because, as a history teacher, I believe that every dictator should have a statue to take down when he falls. In terms of costs, I marked a total of 100 thousand forints, indicating that they would be overpriced anyway, so the rest will be paid by Lőrinc Mészáros. What was offensive in this proposal did not come to light, but it turned out that, on the one hand, you have no sense of humor, and on the other, it turned out that you do read Jobbik's amendments, not unread, but very consciously say no to keeping more money with people. In fact, they don't leave more money than people, but we remember that you took away the housing register, took away the cafeteria, and now you want to withdraw some of the payments according to the intentions of your dear leader, saying that the crisis is coming. Ladies and gentlemen, let us say that you represent not the people here in Parliament, but the Fidesz I have a feeling of déjà vu. I have been a municipal representative for eight years in a city dominated by Fidesz since 2010. There has been no mayor in this city since 2010, there is only one Fidesz governor who does not represent the government, but represents the government in the population. Keeper. Today, it seems that a Fidesz leader has the task of collecting taxes from serfs, like you, as a good vassal, and to prevent serf riots. The only problem is, you know, this mentality, this feudal mentality, it covers all areas of life. Today, not the good head of institutions in this country, not the good hospital director, school principal, who can make good professional decisions, but the good head of institutions who can push government will down workers' throats so that workers do not rebel. And they will not rebel, of course, because everyone is afraid of their workplace; and those who do not have a job are happy to receive some donations from you every four or five years, but perhaps the Secretary of State of Rétvár who distributes potatoes can tell us more about this. [[Deterioration in the benches of Jobbik. Dr. Bence Rétvári: And what did you give the voters?]] You build your power on this, fellow Members: you build your power on financially vulnerable and intimidated people. Therefore, it is important not to elect Fidesz governors in municipal elections, but local local patriots. [[Lawrence Nacsa: DKs!]] who do fight out what is due to a settlement to make money for jobs, wages, public transport or city operations. In the fall, they're gonna have to fight the Fides, and authentic people are gonna have to fight a discredited party. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: You're conspiring with Ferenc Gyurcsány! Is Gyurcsány the authentic one for you?]] And in this fight, every credible candidate and every credible candidate for mayor can count on Jobbik's support. [[Constant interruptions. The president's ringing the bell.]] Because the stakes of this election are huge: the stakes are the dismantling of the Orbán system. Your system was built in the municipalities, and we're going to tear it down there. In Hungarian villages and in Hungarian cities, we will be the first to destroy the Orbán statues that you local kings have built in their heads. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Together with Gyurcs!]] and which, to this day, are preventing this country from developing. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Gyurcsány, forward!]] Yes, we will put an end to the era of revelations, we will put an end to it. [[Dr. Pál Völner: You're starting now!]] That if the Fidesz little kings come up with something stupid, let's say we build a bike lookout tower in the Great Plain, where you can walk up. [[Depreciation in opposition ranks.]] Amazing! , they'll do it [[The president's ringing the bell.]] Because no one dares to tell you that I'm sorry, that's stupid. So, from autumn onwards, no Fidesz party soldiers [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Ferenc Gyurcsány!]] it should be entrusted to professionals to manage settlements, who represent not a party, but the population, together with all its diversity. And imagine, yes, it's very difficult to find common ground between people of different world views, and since 2010, you've been used to this, you know, democracy. Democracy is a work genre [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Is democracy working with Ferenc Gyurcsány? The Democrat who cooperates with Ferenc Gyurcsány?]] We will not save this work, because Hungary is not a stróman, it is not a horse's cup, it is not a party's fief property, but Hungary is our country, and the country will be protected from you and everyone who has robbed this country in the last 30 years. Yes, the last 30 years have taught us one thing: it has taught us that today the real difference is not between man and man, who is right and who is left this kindergarten. The real difference, you know? It's who's fair and who's dishonest. [[Rumble on the pro-government side. Applause on the opposition side. Dr. Bence Rétvári: Is Gyurcsány the decent one?]] [[10.30]] We, right-handers, offer the honest one an alliance. [[Dr. Brenner Koloman to the government representatives: Shame on you!]] For the dishonest and prison. We, Jobbikos, will be the bond of integrity in every Hungarian government. [[Defiance in the ranks of the ruling parties.]] We'll be the guarantee. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: With Gyurcs, really?! Intercoms from the ruling parties.]] so that this country can no longer be looted without consequences. [[Intercoms from the ruling parties. The president's ringing the bell.]] So if someone is running for municipal election because they think that they will be able to promote the Hungarian countryside as mayor or representative, the villages and cities [[Dr. Brenner Koloman intervenes.]] I want you to tell him to put the gun down right now, because we good guys aren't gonna turn a blind eye to any theft. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Only above Gyurcsány's, right?! Just above the Gyurcsány's! The president's ringing the bell.]] I'm the guarantee. So help me God.
u2019-07-12-10	Dear Parliament, We'll get back to work. Dear Parliament, State Secretary Miklós Soltész responds on behalf of the Government [[Intercoms from the opposition.]] to what has been said, and please remain calm. [[Péter Ungár: It will be difficult! Dr. Brenner Koloman: Tell them that, Mr. President, okay?!]]
u2019-07-12-11	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear Parliament, Mr. Team Leader! I agree with you on the one hand, the title of your speech before the agenda was "The Fight Continues!" I beg you to continue the fight, that is the 6.34 percent you have achieved. [[Intercoms from the opposition.]] It's all... [[Constant intervention from the opposition.]] all confirm... confirm the successful fight that shows... [[The president's ringing the bell.]] shows how the Jobbik pursues a discredited policy [[Dr. Pál Völner: There will be even 4 percent! Dr. Brenner Koloman: Zero percent KDNP!]] And Jobbik's politicians have a discredited policy together. [[Dr. Brenner Koloman: Your Bolshevik policies must be better!]] I could say that, and thank you very much for that, and at the end of this cycle closing speech, I can also say that you have held the Jobbik Autumn speech. [[Defiance in Jobbik's ranks. Dr. Brenner Koloman:]] Intercoms from the opposition. ) He told me how they're gonna come together [[Agnes Kunhalmi intervenes.]] and how they will work with those with whom they have not agreed in their policies, not only have they disagreed, but have been fierce enemies. Your policies are completely uncredited. [[Dr. Bence of Rétvári: That's right! That's why you're at 6 percent! Péter Ungár: But KDNP is authentic! Intercoms from the opposition.]] While they said they were thinking in a nation, thinking in people across borders, thinking in Christianity, because it's in their flag, what do you do compared to that? [[Dr. Brenner Koloman: A Christian is a Christian when a principal is fired, isn't he?! Shame!]] Compared to this, they're working with the anti-national forces. [[Péter Ungár: Who is anti-national?!]] Compared to this, you are working with the anti-Hungarian forces. [[Péter Ungár: Who is anti-Hungarian? Dr. Brenner Koloman: You are anti-Hungarians! Bolsheviks! We'll never work with you guys.]] Compared to this, you are working with anti-family forces who want to force an ideology on Hungarian society that is completely alien to Hungarian society, but a few percent of those who are spreading it will join you. [[Szabó Timea intervenes.]] And in the same way, I must say that you are conspiring with forces, anti-Christian forces that hate Christianity. [[Zsolt Gréczy: We don't hate you either! Agnes Kunhalmi: We don't hate you either!]] [[Agnes Kunhalmi intervenes.]] And how they will work with those with whom they have not agreed, let alone disagreed, but were fierce enemies. Your policies are completely uncredited. (Dr. Bence Rétvári: That's right! That's why you're at 6 percent! Péter Ungár: But KDNP is authentic! Intercoms from the opposition. ) While they said they were thinking in a nation, thinking in people across borders, thinking in Christianity, because it's in their flag, what do you do compared to that? (Dr. Brenner Koloman: Christian is a Christian when a principal is fired, right? ! Shame! Compared to this, they're working with the anti-national forces. (Peter Ungár: Who is anti-national? ! Compared to this, you are working with the anti-Hungarian forces. (Péter Ungár: Who is anti-Hungarian? Dr. Brenner Koloman: You are anti-Hungarians! Bolsheviks! We'll never work with you guys!) Compared to this, you are working with anti-family forces who want to force an ideology on Hungarian society that is completely alien to Hungarian society, but a few percent of those who are spreading it will join you. (Szabó Timea interrupts.) And in the same way, I must say that you are united with forces and anti-Christian forces that hate Christianity (Zsolt Gréczy: We do not hate you! Ágnes Kunhalmi: We don't hate you either!) They'd like to bring back the Christian chasing policy of the 50-60-70s. Now, that's the Jobbik, that's why it's uncredited. (Agnes Kunhalmi interrupts.) But don't yell at me a little bit, Congresswoman, so much, but drink a glass of water, and you'll calm down. [[Defiance in the ranks of the opposition. The president's ringing the bell. Agnes Kunhalmi intervenes.]] So the other area, which is completely uncredited, is that you have announced the policy of popular partying. [[Péter Ungár: Is this a political analysis? Dr. Brenner Koloman: You're in the People's Party! The European People's Party!]] EPP means nothing more than trouble-politicisation, trouble-politicisation, which I mentioned earlier, but I repeat 6:34 percent result [[Dr. Brenner Koloman: Tell me three times. KDNP is zero!]] European Union elections. I ask you, and I urge you, to appreciate this result. [[Dr. Brenner Koloman: Say it out loud, KDNP zero! Interview from Jobbik's ranks: Be on your own for once.]] 'Cause they're not gonna get five percent of the unbelievable after that. For their politicalization. [[Intercoms from Jobbik's ranks.]] Why is the politics of Jobbik still uncredited? [[Dr. Brenner Koloman: KDNP is authentic!]] He kept proclaiming the need to leave the European Union. What are they doing now? They work with the strongest anti-immigration forces [[Zsolt Gréczy: You do the same thing! Szabó Timea: You and Soros Scholarships...! Defiance in the ranks of the opposition.]] they are politics with those who are Hungarians and... [[Intercoms from Jobbik: Anti-immigration...!]] loss of speech .......................................................................................................................................... [[Constant intervention from the opposition. The president's ringing the bell.]] They're collaborating with pro-immigration forces. [[Defiance in the ranks of the opposition. Interview from Jobbik: The Autumn Speech of the KDNP!]] I'm sorry for the mistake. What are they doing? They ran into the arms of Ferenc Gyurcsány [[Dr. Brenner Koloman: That was your fall speech, my friend! We'll do that in the morning, at noon, at M1 tonight.]] and they fully support the policy of breaking down borders and breaking down border protection, not preserving borders, and not preserving Hungarians or the European Union as it is. You're working with these forces. It also shows their lack of credibility. [[Intercoms from the opposition.]] [[Intercoms from the opposition.]] And instead, they do nothing but destroy and destroy this country's credibility. (Intercoms from the opposition. ) Dear Chief of Staff, I congratulate you on one thing: you put on your Facebook the following two stories: one of them, that you met Gábor Vona, proudly mentioned it. I'm just asking, who's in charge of this party? Are you the couple president or Gábor Vona? [[Defiance in Jobbik's ranks.]] It's clearly controlled by outside forces, Ferenc Gyurcsány, only you don't realize that. [[Dr. Brenner Koloman: The one you didn't lock up, and you have two-thirds! And why not? And why aren't Flória Farkas in prison and all the other gangsters?! The president's ringing the bell.]] And I would like to congratulate you on one more thing. [[Intercoms from the opposition. The president's ringing the bell.]] : the alliance is also, I hear that the best internship program went well...
u2019-07-12-12	[[Dr. Brenner to Koloman.]] Congressman, you're trying to restrain yourself. [[Dr. Brenner Koloman: Excuse me, Mr. President, it's just that it's hard to tolerate in silence, you can see that, Mr. President.]] Here you go, Secretary of State.
u2019-07-12-13	I hear you've done well with your better-looking practitioners. programme, at least 35 of us have applied to the foosball with you has been a fantastic success, congratulations. [[Defiance in the ranks of the ruling parties. Intercoms from the opposition.]] I'm just asking you. [[Constant intervention from the opposition.]] Continue with the particular road style, not even in the pub, which you are doing, continue to do so. It'll be good for you. It'll be good for your constituents. The Fidesz-KDNP government and its representatives, it is perfectly natural that alongside the nation, while protecting borders, besides Christianity [[Dr. Brenner Koloman: Next to Comrade Karanchi!]] and, of course, we will stand in favour of protecting families, which is why we will clearly vote in favour of next year's budget, and you will do nothing else. [[Dr. Brenner Koloman: Next to corruption! Next to the Orbán family! The president's ringing the bell.]] Just run into Ferenc Gyurcsány's arms! Thank you very much for your speech. [[A statement from Jobbik: You lie like a river, Soltes, that's the problem! Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]]
u2019-07-12-14	Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Dear Parliament, It is still useful to keep the parliamentary form. That's what I'm asking you, even if this is our last session in this cycle. Dear Parliament, He applied for a pre-meeting speech... [[Intercoms.]] Congressman! Before the agenda, Mr Bence Tordai, Member of the Dialogue Group, spoke on the topic of current issues. You have the floor, Congressman.
u2019-07-12-15	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear Parliament, Dear Citizens, Let us appreciate this day, let us appreciate it, because in the next three months Parliament will not meet, because László Kövér has decided to sabotage Parliament's work. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: You're the ones who sabotage it on December 12th!]] We oppositionists will, of course, work, if not here in Parliament, in the municipal campaign, because the goal now is to take more cities and villages and parts of the country back from you, take them back from the people of power to the power of the people. [[Intercoms from the ruling parties.]] To put an end to this greedy grating policy. To put an end to the policy of power, to destroy the Fidesz system by building it from a place. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: With a plastic file in your hand! Sándor Font intervenes.]] Congressman, be quiet, please. [[Defiance among the opposition is the intervention of Sándor Font.]] I look at László Fat... [[Intercoms.]] I quote László Fat, just to understand why there won't be a parliamentary meeting for the next three months, while the Fidesz people take their salary with complete peace of mind. [[Intercoms from the ruling parties: You're not going to answer it?!]] So, the Speaker says that we will not allow the Parliament stage to be a campaign platform for any political power; it has been seen in the last few weeks that, in particular, the representatives of the Dialogue, but sometimes the socialists also thought, [[Dr. Bence Rétvári intervenes. Peter Ungár intervenes.]] that the parliament, the mayor-designate of Gergely Christmas, was on the campaign stage, and there they gave their chorus speeches day after day, week after week; it would be a pity to sink the parliamentary work to such a level before the campaign, so it would be better if we didn't meet until after the elections. [[István Szilárd Németh: He's right, that's right!]] Well, it seems that the gentlemen are shaking, it seems that they are very frightened of losing control of the capital, very frightened of the fact that the governor of Fidesz, István Tarlós, will be replaced by the people of Gergely Christmas. [[There's a grumble in the ranks of the ruling parties.]] And where the parliamentary debate is sinking... Well, look, if we're having a political debate, it's that if we present our policy agenda different from yours, that if it's an unworthy level, it's you. Here we talked about how the city will be alive and livable, how to replace a fidesz governor with a mayor serving the interests of the people, the community of voters, why Gergely Christmas will be a better leader of Budapest than your man... [[László Varju: That's right!]] We did, and we weren't the only ones who did it, because it was quite pathetic and ridiculous when the Fidesz MEPs were asking each other why Gergely Christmas was a very mean person. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: We don't think you're unfit.]] And come on, the Secretary of State would be so kind as to say something bad about him. It was pathetic! If something has demeaned the dignity of Parliament, it has been this. [[Sándor Font: That's you!]] But let us go on, because today we are also voting on the budget, and here is the big deal: you have not been willing to support any of the 800 amendments tabled by the opposition, you have swept everything off the agenda while you are arguing about why we should not vote for your positive proposals. I would like to point out that in some cases, when, exceptionally, these proposals were not in the interests of the Fidesz Party, but in the interests of the people, we have voted in favour of this Parliament. You are incapable of minimal restraint and fairness, unable to accept opposition amendments. [[10.40]] But there's one thing I understand that they don't accept. András Tállai specifically spoke about the most dangerous opposition package in his opinion. I quote him: "The Dialogue seems to stick to the concept of basic income, to which more than HUF 3000 billion would have been spent. That's right, the Dialogue believes in equality as a green left party, believes in human dignity, believes that everyone deserves the safety of living. I will continue with the text of the Secretary of State: This is a huge sum. Indeed; then, let us say, you are not disturbed by the huge sums to be stolen. [[Ágnes Kunhalmi: Private pension funds!]] Otherwise, it is a promise that can be fulfilled, since it is only 6.8 percent of GDP, and the resources are in our amending package. The Secretary of State says: "No wonder the only way to come up with it is to radically transform family support and raise taxes. It is true that we would eliminate the fact that the children of the rich are better supported by the state, and we would really raise taxes on who? The billionaires, the millionaires, the big corporations, the polluters. We would really raise these taxes, that's what a green left party is supposed to do. The Secretary of State does not understand why excise duty and VAT would increase. I'll tell you this: because people would have more money and more money to spend. I understand that this is not your goal. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Consumption has been increasing for 60 months, mate.]] I understand that you are only serving the enrichment of your own NER knights, but allow us to present the interests of the people in the form of budgetary amendments in the basic income modification package to the House. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: What about the basic income in Zuglo?]] They say they're supposed to tax the rich. Well, yes, exactly like the Tiborcz tax, which will be introduced in Budapest after the victory of Gergely Christmas, which will be imposed on their half-billion-dollar palaces and their more expensive, amazing luxury villas. [[János Fónagy: Unlucky! Happy István: Poor Ferenc Gyurcsány... László Szászfalvi: What does Gyurcsány say?]] So get ready for the fall. I understand you don't want to work here, but we're going to work. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Let's hope Mrs. Bango will work too!]] Thank you very much.
u2019-07-12-16	Thank you. Dear Parliament, On behalf of the Government, Mr Csaba Dömötör wishes to respond. You have the floor, Mr. Secretary.
u2019-07-12-17	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Honourable Congressman, I understand that you would like to draw attention to the fact that Gergely Christmas is your candidate, and I understand this effort, but it is a party-competitor: she worked, didn't she, the SZDSZ, then the Gyurcsány government, then LMP, then Együtt-PM, the Together, then she became Together to return to the embrace of Ferenc Gyurcsány. [[Agnes Kunhalmi: How boring! Who was in the Liberal International?]] And the thing is, where Gergely Christmas turned around... [[Agnes Kunhalmi: How was the liberals?]] there, in a political sense, sooner or later [[Agnes Kunhalmi: How was the liberals? The president's ringing the bell.]] It's decomposing. I am now pleased that you have brought up the budgetary debate and the amendments. You make all kinds of proposals, all kinds of vague proposals, but now your most important proposals have also been put in writing in an amendment, which clearly shows the shapeful economic policy of the left: if I could, they would put a massive tax lifting package around the neck of the Hungarians. I propose that each of my fellow Members take a look at the amendment to the Dialogue [[Agnes Kunhalmi: Multis on your neck!]] There's everything left-wing politics has in it: a tax increase, surrounded by a tax increase, spilled all over with a little tax increase. Let's start with the details, the specifics. The proposal is to make income tax more multi-key again. So instead of the current 15%, there would be a higher tax rate. [[Agnes Kunhalmi: Don't lie, we didn't say that!]] We know what that means, because at the time of left-wing governance, there was also a 36 percent tax rate. [[Bence Tordai: Matolcsy's $5 million salary? Yes!]] That's what they want to bring back. [[Bence Tordai: More taxes on ministerial salary? Yes!]] But if I look at previous left-wing proposals, [[Bence of Turdai: A tax increase for you! For you!]] Then it's clear from the fact that I would raise the bottom key. [[A statement from the opposition: We wouldn't raise the bottom key, you're lying!]] So it's quite clear that everyone [[A statement from the opposition: You're lying!]] Those who work in this country would pay more taxes. Then this second would also raise corporate tax, which is also included in the proposal. [[Ágnes Kunhalmi: How big is the VAT?]] You've talked about this before. They'd take me with one stroke of a pen...
u2019-07-12-18	Excuse me, Mr. Secretary...
u2019-07-12-19	... hundreds of billions of businesses, so that's the end of the wage increases. [[Ágnes Kunhalmi: How big is the VAT? The president's ringing the bell. Agnes Kunhalmi, you've raised 5 percent! János Fónagy: Quack, quack, quack. Szabó Timea: Secretary of State, should I also do quack, quack, quack? Because I can do it! Dr. Bence Rétvári: More like the Greywolves!]] On the other hand, Hungary's competitiveness would also be reduced, which would also reduce investment. It's not okay. [[A statement from the opposition: You are lying, VAT revenues are increasing!]] Dear Congresswoman Kunhalmi, Ladies and gentlemen of the Council of Kunhalm! Dear Congresswoman Kunhalmi, You mentioned VAT, and I would like to inform you that this proposal includes a VAT increase, if you would be interested. If someone thinks that I would only raise existing taxes, they are wrong because they also want carbon taxes. How big? Well, big, over $200 billion in carbon taxes. And what they'd tax [[Szabó Timea: You!]] companies and transport. [[Szabó Timea: That's right! Environmentally polluting companies!]] Let's quote Gergely Christmas here: The corporate sphere, transport and transport must be the subject of a wide-ranging carbon tax. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [[Szabó Timea: Only you have not voted to ban plastics in the EU, shame!]] Here's another gem of left-wing politics: taxing motorists. It's a nasty story. In other countries, there is already such a carbon tax, including in France. [[Agnes Kunhalmi: You think there is no climate change, talk about it! Why don't you talk to Ader?]] And in terms of experience, one thing we can say is that such taxes are constantly increasing and making transport more expensive. That is why, among other things, there have been riots in France, which the French President has only been able to alleviate by using violence. In France, by the way, honourable Member, the rate of carbon tax has increased six times the initial value. [[Constant intervention from the opposition benches. Dr. Bence Rétvári's Tordai Bence: For example, he doesn't speak from a plastic folder like you! Szabó Timea: There is no climate change! The president's ringing the bell.]] And it doesn't stop the pressure steamroller, it's in the proposal to abolish the family tax relief in its current form, to pull once again what the Medgyessy government has already pulled. [[Szabó Timea: They wouldn't get any less money for this, you're lying! They'll get more!]] They're plowing up a well-functioning family support system. But it's not even the end of the story. It's not because they want real estate taxes. They claim that this would apply to the rich [[Agnes Kunhalmi: Billionaires!]] while they've already voted on this once. Where was the limit? [[Bence of Turda: What does that have to do with us?]] Forints 30 million had the limit [[Tordai Bence: Luxury villas! Intercom from opposition benches: 30 million? Half a billion! Don't lie to me.]] Which means that, given the current prices, most of the apartments in Budapest would be subject to such a new tax, you know very well. [[Dr. Tamás Bellozó: Mr. President, you keep lying! Szabó Timea: Do you think you can steal without end?]] So, my dear House, what I've presented here is nothing more than the tax lifting package of Gergely Christmas. They want to tax everything that moves, and most of all those who think that work can move forward in this life. Budapest certainly doesn't want any of this, and I think Hungary doesn't want any of this either. Based on such terrible plans, it is no coincidence that Gergely Christmas's party cannot rise above the 1 percent threshold. [[Szabó Timea: Now he has as much support as Tarlos!]] I would like to tell you one thing, no matter how loud they shout, no matter how much they shout: as long as this government is in office, and as long as István Tarlós is the mayor, the Christmas tax raise package will not be anything, you can be sure of that. Mr. Congressman said, [[Ágnes Kunhalmi: Did you get a new car or an apartment in the castle?]] That the majority of the government wiped out your tax-raise proposal. The thing is, yes, we voted against it, we don't want a tax increase. And, you know what? We're proud that we voted against it. Thank you for listening. [[A round of applause from the ruling parties.]]
u2019-07-12-20	I thank you, Mr Secretary of State, for your reply. I would like to say to my fellow Members that this is not a choir to be performed in such a way that you will be heard by the Secretary of State, but you will comment on it. It doesn't work that way, even if it's the last day, it doesn't. [[Szabó Timea: So what? Agnes Kunhalmi: They too!]] Still, Congresswoman. Dear Parliament, We'll get back to work. Member Ms Ágnes Vadai, DK Group has applied for a pre-meeting speech: . Who is the Hungarian? It's an address. You have the floor, Congresswoman.
u2019-07-12-21	Thank you for the floor. Dear House, Ladies and gentlemen, It is very entertaining to hear from you and your home media that the ugly DK MEPs voted your representatives off in Brussels. You're lying that we do what we do because we're not real Hungarians, we don't care about the fate of the country. [[Intercoms from the ruling parties: That's right!]] And we chose George Soros instead of Pacal, Rudi the Turtle, or even the Palinka. [[Defiance in the ranks of the opposition.]] But, my fellow Members, who was the one who used his mandate nine years ago to destroy Hungarian democracy and gradually rebuild the party state? Who, in the history of the Hungarian regime change, has uniquely adopted a one-party constitution that no one except you, but no one, no opposition voter, has supported? [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: You didn't even come in here to argue.]] Who was the one who passed an election law for his own good? Who sent party soldiers to the Constitutional Court to enforce the government's will? [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Is it Mihály Bihari?]] And who was the one who put his former candidate in charge of the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, precisely so that government corruption cases wouldn't get to the indictment? [[Intercoms from the opposition: That's right!]] And who was it who sent another representative, an active representative, to the head of the State Audit Office to eliminate opposition parties with major fines? [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Tihamér Warvasovszky?]] Who was the one who sent fidesz bag barrels to the Media Council, so that the answer would be that no opposition representative could appear on the pro-government TV, that this was unbiased information? And who, my fellow Members, has swept every opposition bill, initiative or budget amendment off the table in the last nine years without any discussion or dialogue? Have you thought about these questions? And who does not give a damn about opposition representatives, who represent at least two and a half million voters in this House, and should have a corresponding weight for their word? [[10.50]] I'll help you, you can choose: a) George Soros, b) the lizards or c) you. Ladies and gentlemen, The big thing is that you, you did this, you replaced modern-day Hungarian democracy and European Hungary with a corrupt, my brother-in-law party state, where one man, Viktor Orbán, is the master of life and death. Then I honestly don't understand that kindergarten whining, as you say, screaming that, oh, the ugly opposition doesn't support us. I don't know what they're surprised about. Now, listen carefully. Where we come from, we will prevent you. [[Dr. Sándor Fazekas: Try it!]] We're gonna cross their last little position. [[Zsolt Gréczy: That's right! Dr. Bence Rétvári: We voted here for all your officials in Parliament!]] The same is waiting for you in the next five years in the European Parliament, what you have done in the last nine years with the opposition voters at home. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: We voted in favour of all your officials! Noise in the lines of DK and Dialogue.]] And before they say it's petty revenge, no! In the last nine years, you have broken every single written and unwritten rule in this country, and you have corrupted my country into an anti-European, corrupt banana republic. [[Dr. Sándor Fazekas: Come on, you gotta be kidding me.]] Shame on you for that. [[There's a grumble in the ranks of the ruling parties.]] However, ladies and gentlemen, if there is no democracy in a country and the representatives of the State Party ignore opposition voters, [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: 2006! Gergényi? State of law?!]] Don't be offended if we treat you accordingly. You betrayed this country, so you won't get any help from us. [[Agnes Kunhalmi applauds.]] You must fail, this is the national interest, and therefore we will do everything we can. [[Agnes Kunhalmi: That's right! Intercoms from the lines of MSZP and DK.]] The anti-Europeans have failed the European Parliament elections, even within the People's Party. The big vest turned into a big jacket, well, wear it with dignity. The only thing left for you in the European Parliament is to quietly stand aside and watch the pro-European forces, including the Democratic Coalition, shape the fate of Europe and Hungary. [[Defiance, noise in the ranks of the governing parties.]] And, ladies and gentlemen, this has nothing to do with who is Hungarian. We do not dispute their Hungarianness. We think you're Hungarian, and we're Hungarians, but you're corrupt bastards, and we're patriots. [[Defiance in the ranks of the ruling parties. Applause in the benches of DK and MSZP.]] And a patriot will never, under any circumstances, help those who betray his country, either at home or in Brussels, and even if he cooks fusion pacle soup. Thank you. [[Applause in the benches of DK, MSZP and Dialogue.]]
u2019-07-12-22	Dear Parliament, I think I'd say one sentence in my heart, but I'm guessing Secretary of State will do it for me. [[Dr. Agnes Vadai: Don't do it! It's not your job to comment on what's going on, it's your job to lead the meeting properly. I want you to drive this seat impartially.]] Secretary of State, you have the floor. [[Zsolt Gréczy: It is not your job to comment, but to lead the meeting.]] State Secretary Csaba Dömötör responds on behalf of the government. You have the floor, Mr. Secretary. [[Moraj, interventions from the ranks of MSZP, DK and Dialogue. Dr. Ágnes Vadai: Excuse me. Szabó Timea: Mr. President is not sitting there to say a sentence. Dr. Ágnes Vadai: Sitting there to lead the meeting impartially!]] Congresswoman, you have spoken, you have finished, I ask you to listen to the answer. [[Noise in the lines of DK and MSZP.]] You have the floor, Mr. Secretary.
u2019-07-12-23	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Three brief reactions: on the one hand, I do not want to comment on the opposition's behavioral and educational problems. As regards the government's lack of assistance, thank you very much, Ferenc Gyurcsány we do not need your help. [[Dr. Ágnes Vadai: Then why are you screaming?! Szabó Timea: Then why are you screaming?!]] As far as democracy is concerned, we do not ask eye-shooters to lecture us. As regards the events in Brussels, it is indeed difficult to find words about what the opposition, led by DK, has done in Brussels in recent days. Let's just say the word shame comes to mind, but there are far more subtle opinions. They launched a campaign against Hungarian candidates, they want to turn down the voice of Hungarians in Brussels. [[Dr. Ágnes Vadai: Not the Hungarians, only the Fideszessers! Zsolt Gréczy and Gergely Arató: Only the Fideszsers!]] So they stepped up in the mine work against Hungary, and instead of looking down and wandering under the gardens, they are proud of it. [[Zsolt Gréczy: You get the same thing you did! Szabó Timea: It is not an exception to 53 percent!]] We do not know who they work for, but certainly not for Hungary. What's this about? It began with the attempt to drill Lívia Járóka's Vice-President of the European Parliament, who was not, incidentally, the first Member of Roma origin in the European Parliament. [[Zsolt Gréczy: said the former President of the Liberal International! Szabó Timea: Being a Roma is not an acquittal!]] In addition to the Roma strategy, it is also fighting for a pan-European strategy against poverty. If you really wanted to fight poverty and integrate the Roma, you wouldn't have drilled his candidacy. [[Intercoms from the ranks of the governing parties, among them: Yes!]] But that's not what's important, it's just their own power interests. [[Szabó Timea: Lívia Járóka is also your man!]] But the left didn't stop here. The Momentum task force launched a campaign to prevent the election of certain Hungarian candidates to positions. So the chicks barely hatched from the SZDSZ-subtitled egg, and they've already hit the country. [[Noise, interruptions from the opposition benches.]] Several left-wing factions joined to this, and you joined. [[Dr. Ágnes Vadai and Szabó Timea intervene. The president's ringing the bell.]] With this premeditated campaign, both the agreement between the factions and the customary law were broken. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and This agreement is not a case-by-case agreement, but it has been operating this way for several decades, so that the results of the elections are reflected in the leading positions of Parliament. [[Zsolt Gréczy: Then why didn't you support László Andor and László Kovács?!]] That's what you guys kicked up. You have turned your back on democracy! I would like to inform you, but you know very well that there is such a custom in the Hungarian Parliament. That is why Congressman Hiller can be Vice-President of the House, which is why Congressman Sneider can be Vice-President of the House, which is why Congressman Mirkóczki can be Chairman of the National Security Committee, and, honourable Member, that is why you can be Vice-President of the Defence Committee. [[Dr. Agnes Vadai intervenes.]] Not because they were so bright in the election. So let me ask you this, honourable Member, do you think it would be acceptable for the pro-government majority to withdraw support from all opposition officials? [[Szabó Timea: Draw!]] Whatever you're thinking. [[Dr. Ágnes Vadai: Retract!]] No matter what they think about it. [[Interviews from DK and Dialogue The president is ringing.]] If this were to happen, all the international forums would be telecasted about the state of Hungarian democracy, even the non-existent institutions would be teletaked. They turned their backs on what they were doing in Brussels, not on us, but on Hungarian people and Hungarian representatives. [[Zsolt Gréczy: That's not true! Fidesz!]] who, on the one hand, supported 53 percent of the governing parties and who, whatever they think about different cases, [[Szabó Timea: So what? 47 percent didn't support it!]] They certainly do not expect elected MEPs to weaken Hungarian representation, especially when budgetary negotiations are on the rise. [[Noise, interruptions from DK and Dialogue. Zsolt Gréczy: Under no circumstances do we support the Fidesz people! The president's ringing the bell.]]
u2019-07-12-24	Congresswoman Timea Szabó! Secretary of State, you have the floor.
u2019-07-12-25	By my words, honourable Member, that 53 percent of the government parties were honoured with their trust, you yelled at me about what was going on. [[Szabó Timea: What about 47 percent? ...there's more than you!]] Madam Member, this is democracy, get used to it. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties. Noise, interruptions in the lines of Dialogue, DK and MSZP.]] Madam President, if you have energy between the two yellings, allow me to suggest that you study historical works and not only historical works, but also literary works. [[Szabó Timea: You study Mikszath!]] and you will see that the Hungarians have never supported those who have turned against them and have adapted their policies to foreign expectations. The one who betrayed that trust never got it back. You guys often run around in all kinds of T-shirts with all kinds of inscriptions on them. We've seen many kinds of inscriptions, so I suggest you put on a T-shirt once that says I'm Hungarian, and once you've worn it, you should take it seriously. [[Gergely Harvesto: We don't have to prove it!]] Thank you for listening. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties. Intercoms from DK's ranks. The president's ringing the bell.]]
u2019-07-12-26	Dear Parliament, As far as we're gonna be before summer break, please back off. We'll get back to work. Péter Harrach, Head of the Group, KDNP Group, asked for a pre-meeting speech on the protection of nature as part of our Christian responsibility. You have the floor, Mr. Group Leader.
u2019-07-12-27	Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, The previous heated debate reminded me of a sentence by Churchill, which says: when I was in opposition, I took care not to say a bad word about my country's government abroad. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties. Zsolt Gréczy: But he wouldn't have done anything to take EU funding away from his country! Viktor Orbán is a traitor! Noise. The president's ringing the bell.]] Let's row to more peaceful waters. [[11.00]] We often marvel at what a rich and beautiful world we live in, and not only the beauty of nature, but also the richness of the world of man; of course I do not mean this parliamentary wealth. When we see the vulnerability of these, we have the instinct of protection, but conscious protection also has an ideal basis and a root of the world's vision. There are two of these practices, different from one another, but with common features here and there in its solutions and goals. One is the liberal, ecocentric defense, the other is the Christian, anthropocentric environmental thinking. [[It's constant noise.]] Now I do not aim to criticize you before, even if it pleases me, but to present Christian creation and protection. If I want to sum this up in a sentence, I have to say that man should be a caring owner of the created world. What does the master mean, and what does the caregiver mean? We can't forget that the creation is for man. Mihály Babits expresses this much more beautifully than I do, and if I may, I would like to quote a few sentences from him: "Do you know how everything happens for you? / The eternal rotation of the stars spins to you / and speaks to you, it's your business, all things are for you For he made heaven and earth and seas for your sake, that they might be fulfilled in you;............................................................................................................................. This not only presents man, the most perfect and magnificent creature, but also reflects all his thoughts for you. And let's just say we still have to add care to that. [[There's always a lot of noise. The president's ringing the bell.]] If we look at today's ecological problems, we need to see that these are due to lack of care. Let me quote II. Pope John Paul's sentence: the ecological crisis is a moral problem. The ultimate cause of this problem is human insatiability and direct cause in human activity. Speaking of Christian responsibilities, let me quote a church document: our economic arrangement is based on unlimited growth and competition in the market that creates this. The urge to grow in a finite space, like the Earth, inevitably leads to problems. So the question is: profit maximization or common good? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm I am convinced that consistency between economic activity and nature conservation can be achieved. However, the increase and exclusivity of economic competition will eventually lead to an environmental disaster. There is a need for restraint, especially for the podium participants of the tournament. Hungary is barely capable of influencing global processes. Of course, the fact that we are not large pests does not mean that we have to sit on our hands. We have work to do, both individually and as a community. The specific facts show that Hungary is doing well in terms of the long-term evolution of emissions. Data on industrial and residential emissions improved in the short term. However, improvements need to be made in transport and transport. It is true, of course, that this is primarily the task of the car companies. But the fact is that Hungary is ready for 2003 meeting the climate target. To conclude, once again, let me repeat the main principle of this problem: the need for development and growth must be limited by the requirement of responsibility. Thank you for your attention. [[Applause in the pro-government benches.]]
u2019-07-12-28	Thank you, Mr. Group Leader. Dear Parliament, Before I give Mr Secretary the opportunity to answer, I would like to ask my fellow Members, who are arriving now, to sit quietly. There's very high ground noise in the room. You can barely hear the speech. You have the floor, Mr. Secretary.
u2019-07-12-29	Thank you very much, Mr. President. Ladies and gentlemen, Dear Chief of Staff, Thank you very much for your responsible contribution, and perhaps, as a basis, we can conclude that it is important for all of us to protect the environment and the climate. We all want clean air, clean water and a more bearable climate. I believe that it has been said many times here in Parliament over the past period that the current government has done everything to ensure that this demand, this expectation, will continue in the next period, and that the situation will even improve. [[It's constant noise. The president's ringing the bell.]] I'd like to split my answer into two parts. One would focus on environmental protection and the other on the tasks carried out in the field of climate protection, since you, too, separated in your speech and yet linked the two areas, said your thoughts. First, I would like to say a few words about nature conservation. In Hungary, we also pay very serious attention to nature conservation by knowing that about one third of the country's territory is in some form protected by nature. We have two million hectares of wood, which is very large, but the government has set itself a goal, for example, not least to ensure that the green forest is a powerful tool for climate protection, that we will increase the 20.9 per cent forest fry to 27 per cent in the next decade or a decade and a half. For example, a good example of this is that in recent years, in the last economic and financial cycle of the European Union, national parks have been given a HUF 40 billion opportunity to renew the fauna in the national park and to preserve the situation, the beautiful situation that national parks can show in our natural values. It has started and is in the process of planting 22 million saplings in order to achieve the aforementioned goal in the next period, as we also need to know that in the area of climate protection, green and forest can help a great deal. About 6 million tons of carbon dioxide are bound annually by the forest stock in Hungary. So one part of what has been said in the field of nature conservation proves that we have done, do and will do a great deal for the protection of nature in recent years, and that we will also help climate protection to carry out its task. But in the other area, in the area of climate protection, which is directly trying to prevent CO2 emissions or greenhouse gas emissions, we have also taken countless measures in this area. And what results have we achieved since 2010 and 1990? We have a very, very high ranking position in the European Union. In total, there are 21 countries, not in the European Union, but in the world, that have been able to reduce CO2 emissions compared to 1990, while increasing economic performance, i.e. our specific emissions have decreased significantly. [[Noise. The president's ringing the bell.]] This 32 percent decrease is also a significant result for states generally declared climate champions by greens, such as Denmark, because Denmark has shown us better performance than Sweden and Germany, for example, we have better performance than Sweden and Germany. In the light of the fact that six EU Member States have not reduced but have increased CO2 emissions over the past period, Hungarian performance is particularly remarkable. [[Bence Tordai enters Dr. Bence of Retvári and starts talking.]] Our emissions related to the production of unit national income have decreased by 24 percent since 2010, i.e. not since 1990, but since 2010. This means that the economy is growing in Hungary while emissions, greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 emissions have decreased significantly. Of course, the share of heat plants [[It's constant, it's loud. The president's ringing the bell.]] We are trying to reduce this, and it is also evidence that the production of solar electricity has increased significantly over the past period, reaching 700 megawatts today, and we want to produce 3000 megawatts of power by the solar power plants by 2030. This means that in a few decades the ratio of nuclear energy and renewable energy in Hungary will reach 90 percent. This is where nuclear energy needs to be addressed, which is the most important climate protection option. [[The president's ringing again.]] [[The president's ringing again.]] 17 million tonnes per year has been proven in recent years for our country (The President is ringing again). Saved Hungary from carbon dioxide emissions.
u2019-07-12-30	[[To the Bence of Turda in front of Dr. Bence Retvári:]] Congressman!
u2019-07-12-31	This will continue in the next period if Paks II. It's happening. Thank you for your attention. [[Applause in the pro-government benches.]] [[11.10]]
u2019-07-12-32	Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Dear Parliament, I would ask my fellow Members to take their seats before the next agenda. The basic noise is so high, you can't hear the speeches. Congressman Torda, have a seat. We're not doing interviews in Parliament's meeting room, so I'm warning you. [[Bence of Turdai is going to replace his representatives.]] Dear Parliament, Mr Csaba Hende, Chairman of the Legislative Committee, applied for a pre-meeting address with the title "Actual Affairs." You have the floor, Mr. President.
u2019-07-12-33	Thank you for the floor. Mr President, Dear Parliament, Istova has not been able to vote against each other in the distribution of parliamentary seats based on the electoral will for thirty years. It is an unwritten rule, but it has a system that rests on electoral will. The seats of the European Parliament were also determined by the democratically expressed will of the electorate. Any digging, any action that affects it, especially on behalf of the Democratic Coalition. [[Dr. Agnes Vadai raises and spreads his arms.]] the smothering and mocking of voters, not to mention taking me on dangerous roads. I mean, if this practice had been developed in the Parliament at home, [[Dr. Ágnes Vadai: Yes, so what?]] there wouldn't be a lot of positions for the opposition. They're sailing into dangerous waters, because, of course, there would have been a huge circus at home if we hadn't left positions for you in the majority of us. László Varju would not be president of the Committee on Budgets today, Ágnes Vadai would not be vice-president of the Defence and Police Committee, and Lajos Oláh would not be in the Committee on European Affairs. [[Dr. Ágnes Vadai: So what?]] Compared to this, you in Brussels have already started digging against your own country. [[Zsolt Gréczy: László Ander, László Kovács!]] They move to ensure that the representatives of Fidesz are not able to serve as Vice-Presidents of the Committee, while these posts, these places are based on an agreement between the factions and, according to the EPP nomination, they would be represented by the representatives of Fidesz. They also go against the will of the Hungarian people. These committee seats, these posts, would give us and will give us the opportunity to enforce Hungary's national interests even more strongly. [[Dr. Agnes Vadai: To steal more, we know!]] All that was authorized by the Hungarian people on 26 May. The Fidesz-KDNP 13 Group will do everything in its power to stop immigration. [[György Balla: That's right!]] for the Europe of Nations and for the protection of Christian culture. We will also initiate the closure of the migrant card programme and the withdrawal of the draft migrant visa by the new European Parliament, because both programmes will increase immigration. Dear Parliament, We still have the largest Hungarian delegation in the European Parliament [[Dr. Ágnes Vadai: But not the largest faction!]] And we'll have representatives in all 22 committees. Hungarian national interest is to have Hungarian Vice-Presidents on as many European Parliament committees as possible. Dear Enemies, On the first week of the European Parliament's work, you have been rudely opposed to the outcome of the Hungarian elections when you tried to drill Lívia Járóka into becoming Vice-President of the European Parliament. [[An intervention from the ranks of Fidesz: Shame!]] However, because of the actions of the representatives of Fidesz, this effort has failed. While Lívia Járóka congratulated your list leader, Mrs Gyurcsány replied [[Dr. Ágnes Vadai, László Varju: Klára Dobrev!]] That he didn't vote for the Fidesz candidate. Now, that's the difference between us. We welcome the fact that, anywhere in the world, Hungarians hold an important position, we thought it was a positive development that two of the 14 Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament were Hungarian and could represent Hungarian interests. Your behavior is unprecedented. Neither European nor Hungarian politics [[Dr. Agnes Vadai: Stop whining.]] it is not democratic to dig against the representatives elected by the people. They ignore the will of voters, which is contrary to the most fundamental democratic values. Mrs Gyurcsány [[Dr. Agnes Vadai: Mónikaan Sajlai!]] The Socialists and the Momentumists immediately joined the pro-immigration forces of the European Parliament and are in the same group as the wildest pro-immigrationists. Mrs Gyurcsány represents the pro-immigration people in the European Parliament at home, Mrs Gyurcsány. They are looking for positions for this, the influence of power in the European Parliament as well. Dear House, Given that the agreement based on the electorate's decision has been terminated by the opposition, it is certainly questionable whether, for example, the representatives of the Democratic Coalition can expect this to happen in the future. Thank you very much for your attention. [[A round of applause from the benches of the governing parties.]]
u2019-07-12-34	Thank you very much, Mr. President. Dear Parliament, On behalf of the Government, Mr Csaba Dömötör, State Secretary, responds to what has been said. You have the floor, Mr. Secretary.
u2019-07-12-35	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Since this issue has already been discussed, so the opposition's minework, allow me to react briefly and repeat myself. [[Zsolt Gréczy: Let's hear it! Hard!]] A campaign was launched against Hungarian candidates [[László Varju: Against Fidesz! Don't confuse the two.]] They want to lower Hungary's voice on the international stage, and the situation is that they have taken a level in the minework against Hungary. The Hungarians have never supported it, nor will they support it. Since this is the last plenary day of the summer session, allow me to talk about some results and a few words about the tasks ahead. We have had a busy time, many things have happened that affect not only our daily lives, but also the future of Hungary. These include the European election; the predictions that this will be the most important European election in 2019 have been confirmed. The result, the 53 percent result, confirmed the governing parties and set out the most important things to do. There is an extensive debate on the future of Europe, and the Hungarians have made it clear what they stand for in this debate. They want a strong Europe that builds on its diversity, which is able to defend itself, which builds on nation states, and which is able to reinvigorate the foundations that once made it so great. The result of the election obliges everyone, especially the pro-government politicians, which is why we have supported and supported candidates for EU leadership, who not only take these expectations into account, but are also able to fight for them. The decision to lead the European Commission is encouraging because it can be a clean slate in European politics. I do not think that we do not think that we will have debates in the future, but we do think that we have a good chance of a new Brussels policy, a policy that does not want to lecture us, and does not look at our countries with colonial pride, but is able to compromise in the jungle of European interests. No one should think that the debate on the future of Europe has ended with the election; in fact, it has only just begun, because migration has not passed, and we also have nice work to do in the area of economic performance in Europe. Everyone can also be sure that the government and the governing parties will continue to engage in discussions, and in all respects we would like to end the era of coercion, the era when the Visegrád countries were sufferers and not shapers of the events. International debates also need to be taken up because this is the basis for our country's economic growth. Our goal is to make everyone feel it every day. As far as living issues are concerned, we can report more results. The family protection action plan has been launched; we would like to thank the millions of citizens who have founded this programme in their opinion. They are also responsible for the fact that there is baby shower support today, the home creation program is expanding, and among other things, the village CSOK program can be launched. We will never give up hope that one day the opposition will see that strengthening the family support system is in the interest of the country, that the tearing up of the consultation questionnaire will not lead to anything, and that there will be no future without strengthening Hungarian families. As far as other decisions are concerned, employers' taxes have been further reduced at the beginning of July. This is of greater importance than itself, because it creates the possibility of further wage increases. We believe that the way to higher wages is through tax cuts, and here there is a world that separates the parties of government and the opposition. In recent years, wages have increased steadily in Hungary, but as they still have room to grow, we would like this process not to be broken. This is what the economic protection action is all about, and this is what the 2020 budget is all about. [[11.20]] It is a budget that provides more resources for virtually every priority area compared to this year, a budget that serves Hungary's further strengthening. Therefore, if someone is interested in the security of the country, the strengthening of families and the ever more worthwhile work in Hungary, he can wholeheartedly support the proposal regardless of our worldview differences. By the way, we know what the opposition wants, there is also a world that separates us from each other: it wants a change, it wants a corporate tax increase, it wants a carbon tax, it wants a property tax, and it wants to abolish the system of family tax incentives in its current form. We don't want any of this. Dear House, We have a good hope of achieving greater prosperity in addition to our hard - earned freedom. The government will try to fulfill that hope. Everything is therefore in order for Hungary to continue to grow stronger; only one opposition should now be able to take the side of Hungarian families at least in the priority cases. The opportunity is given, fellow Members, so take it. Thank you for listening. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]]

Mr. President, you have the floor.
u2019-07-12-43	Dear Parliament, Mr President, Mr. Prime Minister, On 8 July 2019, the Speaker of Parliament sent a single bill on Hungary's central budget for the year 2020 including the transposition of the amendments adopted by the Parliament. Requested by the Fiscal Council Stability Act 25. According to Article 44 of the Law, its opinion on compliance with the sovereign debt rule and the prior consent of the Fundamental Law pursuant to Article 44 (3) to the final vote on the bill. On the basis of the examination of the Council, at its meeting on 10 July 2018, it took the following decision as a single opinion. It concluded that the planned government debt indicator of 31 December 2020 was T/6322/846 on the country's central budget for next year. Single bill No.3 § 3 is well founded, in line with the provisions of the Stability Act and the macroeconomic and public finances processes on which the bill is based. As the government debt ratio calculated by the end of 2020 is 65.5 per cent lower than the 68.6 per cent expected by the end of 2019, the requirement of Article 36 (5) of the Fundamental Law is also met. On this basis, the Board gave its prior consent pursuant to Article 44 (3) of the Fundamental Law in accordance with Article T/632/846. The final vote of the single bill. Dear Parliament, Please allow me, again this year, to give a very brief justification for the decision of the Council. The framework of the sovereign debt rule is defined by the Fundamental Law as follows: , as long as the public debt exceeds half of the total domestic product, Parliament may only adopt a central budget law containing a reduction in the proportion of the public debt compared to the total domestic product. The Stability Act also provides for the development of public debt. This Parliament amended from 2016 taking into account the indications of the Fiscal Council. On the basis of the macroeconomic conditions used in budget planning, the following will apply by 2020: as one of the projected inflation for the budget year and the real growth rate of gross domestic product does not exceed 3 per cent, the government debt ratio should be reduced by at least 0,1 percentage points. It is clear from the single bill that the debt indicator could decrease by much more than 3.1 percent next year. The Council also welcomed the fact that the foreign exchange ratio of the central budget debt could be reduced from 50 per cent at the end of 2011 to 14.4 per cent by the end of 2020 and expected to be even lower in the coming years and that debt financing could rely heavily on domestic savings. As a result, the exposure of debt to external effects is significantly reduced. Dear Members, Ladies and Gentlemen, In the process of the Council, he followed the parliamentary discussion of the draft budget law. On the basis of a review of the draft single budget law, it concluded that the changes in appropriations adopted by Parliament compared to the bill submitted would increase the amount of certain expenditure of the central subsystem by around 33 billion. The source of this was mainly created through internal expenditure transfers and, to a minimum, by increasing the VAT revenue allocation. In this way, both the cash flow and profit deficit and the planned amount of government debt remain unchanged. The reserve for extraordinary expenditure of 1 per cent of GDP and the allocation of the National Defence Fund, which is higher than in previous years, do not change. Thus, according to the Budget Council, the risks are sufficient to reduce our economic performance, to reduce the margin of movement on the external market, to strengthen the known geopolitical and commercial tensions and to compensate for others. Dear Parliament, The 2020 Budget Act not only meets the European Union's public deficit and public debt requirements, but has also come very close to meeting the structural balance rule. In addition, the Fiscal Council highlighted the need for responsible budgetary management in 2020 to maintain sound and favourable public finances. Dear Parliament, Thank you for your attention, and I wish you a pleasant summer after the final vote. [[A round of applause from the benches of the governing parties.]] [[11.40]]

I would like to inform you that a motion to waive the immunity of Márta Demeter, LMP, Member of Parliament has been received by KSB.5259/2018/7-I. I'm on a case against the Attorney General. The president of the Parliament gave this to the immunity committee for examination. The immunity committee is H/6858. Mr Márta Demeter presented a proposal for a resolution on the immunity of MP, and the Parliament decided on this without debate. Before taking a decision, I will give the floor to János Harghitai, Chairman of the Committee, who intends to give oral reasons for the committee's proposal in a five-minute time frame. Mr. President, please.
u2019-07-12-45	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear Parliament, As has been said, the Attorney General's motion for the waiver of the immunity of Congresswoman Márta Demeter for the crimes of misdemeanour. According to the documents sent, Márta Demeter entered the air base in Kecskemét as Vice-President of the Defence Committee on 19 September 2018 and looked, with the advance knowledge of the Minister of Defence, into a flight log. The specialist there informed the Member that the data to which she looks are not publicly available in the public interest. Congresswoman Márta Demeter there in Kecskemét has also learned a certificate dated 6 September 2018, allowing a young woman named Orbán Flóra to travel from Cyprus to Kecskemét on a military plane. So these are the facts that the congresswoman has come to know. [[11.50]] On 16 October, the Member also asked the Minister of Defence Tibor Benkő and Minister of Interior Sándor Pintér a written question, alive with the right of her Members of Parliament, where she was already asking these facts unsubstantiated about how the Prime Minister's daughter had travelled on such a military plane. Even on the day that he sent these documents to the Office of Parliament, he photographed them and uploaded them to his Facebook profile, and there he made a similar comment. On the basis of the investigative documents, it appears that the aim here was that, by falsifying non-public data in the public interest, the congresswoman wished to include the Hungarian Defence and Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in a negative social assessment and to place... [[Dr. Agnes Vadai: These are lies! Intercoms from the opposition.]] The Attorney General is the act of the Btk. 305. If you consider it contrary to point (c) of paragraph (c), you consider it appropriate for a reasonable suspicion of a criminal offence of administrative abuse. The substantiated suspicion of the crime is supported by testimonies and documents. At today's immunity committee, the congresswoman appeared and expressed her position there. The Parliamentary Committee has followed its practice by a majority vote, and by 4 votes in favour, 2 against Parliament's motion to suspend the parliamentary immunity of the congresswoman in the case in question. Thank you. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]]
u2019-07-12-46	Thank you very much, Mr. President. Dear Parliament, I will ask Mrs Márta Demeter to take the opportunity to speak. [[Márta Demeter rises to speak.]] Yeah, I'll give you the floor in a five-minute time frame.
u2019-07-12-47	Thank you for the floor. Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's no longer a question for any of us that they're suing me for insubordination. [[There's a grumble in the ranks of the ruling parties.]] It doesn't matter what robe this is wrapped in, I think it's absolutely obvious. [[Interjection from the ranks of the governing parties: Legal! Dr. Brenner Koloman: What are you talking about? What's legal?!]] However, it did not surprise anyone in Hungary, as on 15 March 2018 it was promised that they would use all means to deal with their political opponents, it is quite clear that this is part of it, whether it is taken away from opposition representatives in Parliament, or even to the extent that they do not answer certain questions, they are trying to avoid giving information to public interest data requests, until they are now wrapped in legal robes in such aspirations and political aspirations. [[L. Simon László: Keeping secrets!]] I am not asking myself the question, and I have received such feedback in part of society about what they are so afraid of, because it seems that in recent months there has been a tendency in which the government's reactions to certain things are characterised by an increasing verbal aggression. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: After Vadai you say that?! After Vadai?!]] I think it's completely incomprehensible. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: Have you listened to Agnes Vadai?!]] And we'd like to know what's causing this. It is clear that the months-long process of trying to make it impossible for opposition representatives to do their job will lead them to try to act with ever more powerful means. But I would like to inform you that we have been sent to the Hungarian Parliament to check on the government's activities. [[Laszlo Szászfalvi: Ja! That didn't work! It didn't work!]] And I would like to make this kind of control function and control activity as impossible as possible, the ever-increasing control powers, it seems very likely to be further limited and most intimidated by opposition representatives, so that they do not want to or dare to do their work in this direction. What I am saying, however, is that let me propose one more thing, for example, to the Attorney General's attention, that if there is any time left, his energy, in addition to pursuing the political opponents of Fidesz, is to do so, to prosecute government actors on suspicion of some real crimes. [[A statement from the opposition: That's right! Dr. Bence Rétvári: Like subway 4?!]] I would like to give you a few examples: concealing considerable wealth, Btk. 396. §, fiscal fraud; political influence on the functioning of the Public Prosecutor's Office and other state institutions, Btk. 305. §, abuse of office; offshore, inside information, influence of tenders, sale of real estate at a lower price, Btk. 376. §, infidel treatment and Btk. 399. §, money laundering; covering up corruption criminal cases of government politicians, Btk. 282. §, acquiescence; the case of the Castle of 60 Puszta, Btk. 305. §, abuse of office; Elios Zrt. procurements restricting competition, Btk. 420. §, restrictive agreement in the procurement concession procedure. For example, in the Gruevski case, we have also filed a complaint, which is currently under way, and I very much hope that it will be properly investigated. For my part, allow me to say that if proceedings are initiated, I am, of course, aware of the procedure. But I would like to stress that whether you like it or not, it is up to opposition representatives to control the operation of the government to control the use of public funds. [[Dr. Bence Rétvári: There's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing wrong with that. Intercoms.]] and this is the work that we will continue to do in the future [[The president's ringing the bell.]] Of course, we'll take care of it. I'll take care of it myself. Thank you very much.
u2019-07-12-48	Thank you. Dear Parliament, It's time for a decision. I would like to remind you that the committee has taken a position that the Member's immunity will be suspended by the Parliament. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the suspension of immunity requires a vote in favour of two thirds of the Members of Parliament present. I ask the Honourable Parliament to suspend the immunity of MP Márta Demeter. Please vote now. [[Vote.]] I declare the resolution: Parliament suspended the immunity of Congresswoman Márta Demeter by 131 votes in favour, 52 votes against and no abstentions. Dear Parliament, I would like to inform you that a motion to suspend the immunity of Dr. Széván Simon Serkisian as an Armenian ethnic advocate has been received 18.B.204/2019/81. I'm a member of the Metropolitan Tribunal on a public charge. The Speaker of Parliament has issued this to the immunity committee for examination. The immunity committee is H/6859. Mr Szekisian Szván presented a proposal for a resolution on the immunity of the Armenian minority advocate Simon. The Parliament shall decide on this without debate. Before taking a decision, I will give the floor to János Harghitai, Chairman of the Committee, who intends to give oral reasons for the committee's proposal in a five-minute time frame. Mr. President, you have the floor.
u2019-07-12-49	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear Parliament, As has been said, Dr. Serkisian Szván Simon, the Metropolitan Court of Justice, has proposed the suspension of his immunity as a ethnic advocate. The line of acts on which this is based dates back to the then minority minority elections in October 2014, then the advocate did not yet have immunity, because he was not a minority advocate, but he started the elections in the colours of a cultural association. The act we see from the investigative documents is based on 13 counts, of which three are co-conspirators and ten are accomplices to the act that the Btk committed. 350. § (1) (e) describes and constitutes a crime against the order of elections. In short, I could describe what we have always heard through the press as an ethnobiznis: homeless people were approached at a homeless shelter, with some financial benefits and financial benefits, they were persuaded to declare themselves Armenian national and register on the Armenian list, and on election day they were helped to cast their votes. If this has been well completed, this material promise has also been turned into a material advantage. This is behind the series of events in the case of the speaker and others. [[12.00]] The court has obviously observed that Svan Serkisian has immunity in the meantime, an advocate of the Parliament, and that is why he is turning to the National Assembly, stopping the procedure in which he asks us to suspend his immunity. At today's meeting of the immunity committee, the speaker could express his position for a long time. As a public prosecutor, the immunity committee has unanimously decided to suspend the immunity of the advocate in this case. Thank you for your attention. [[A round of applause from the ruling parties.]]
u2019-07-12-50	Thank you very much, Mr. President. Dear Parliament, Mr Szekisian Simon spokesperson is not in the Chamber, so there is no possibility for him to speak. Dear Parliament, Now it's time for the decision. I would like to remind you that the committee has taken a position to suspend the immunity of the spokesperson from the Parliament. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the suspension of immunity requires a vote in favour of two thirds of the Members of Parliament present. I ask the Honourable Parliament to suspend the immunity of Dr. Serkisian Szván Simon Armenian ethnic advocate. Please vote now. [[Vote.]] I declare the resolution: the Parliament suspended the immunity of Serkisian Szván Simon with 174 unanimous votes in favour. Dear Parliament, We've reached the end of the decisions. While you're in the room, allow me to wish you a pleasant summer, a good rest, and thank you for your cooperation so far. Thank you. Dear Parliament, I'm ordering a two-minute break. [[It's a short break. Several Members are leaving the Chamber.]] Dear Parliament, We'll get back to work. I would ask my fellow Members, who wish to be here for the rest of the sitting, to take their place, who wish to leave the Chamber, please do so. Thank you for your understanding. Dear Parliament, We now have post-scheduled speeches. After the agenda, Mr Zsolt Nyitrai, the Fidesz Group, came forward. I give the floor to the Member and ask my fellow Members to leave the Chamber quietly. Here you go, Congressman.
u2019-07-12-51	Mr President, Dear Parliament, I asked for the floor after the agenda because on Sunday, 23 June, more than 12 settlements of Heves County were struck by lightning, the water shut the settlements away from the outside world in a matter of moments, institutions became inoperable, families had to be put to safety very quickly. The extent of the damage is very significant, resulting both from destroyed, damaged goods, values and from the cost of restoration. However, Honourable Parliament, there is something good about all evils: this emergency has shown that people living locally can join together and provide quick and effective help. Maybe that's why there was no serious personal injury. Ladies and gentlemen, Here, in front of the public of the Hungarian Parliament, I would like to thank those who helped protect the flood. I would like to thank the local residents involved in flood protection. We should thank voluntary and professional firefighters, disaster workers and policemen. Thank you, too, for the vigilantes. With all due respect to local entrepreneurs who volunteered to help protect, dredge and transport. Let's also give a slap to the mayors who control flood protection; we'll keep the mayors in touch with about repairing the damage. With the water coming down, it had to be cleaned, disinfected, restored to the conditions and normal conditions of everyday life. Dear Parliament, The cost of restoration is estimated at HUF 350 million and the cost of protection exceeds HUF 10 million. As lightning flood affects more than 12 settlements in Heves county, two constituencies are involved, so together with my fellow Member László Horváth, we ask the Government of Hungary to help the settlements to repair and compensate for the damage caused by lightning flood as soon as possible. Dear Parliament, Mr President, Thank you so much for listening. [[A round of applause from the ruling parties.]]
u2019-07-12-52	Thank you very much, Congressman. Dear Parliament, I'm asking you, someone from the government wants to respond. [[Intercom from the opposition benches: He's not even in the room!]] I don't see any contact. Dear Parliament, On behalf of Mr Ungár Péter, the Group of the LMP, he also applied for an after-the-date speech entitled "The Queen of the West." You have the floor, Congressman.
u2019-07-12-53	Thank you for the floor. Mr President, It is very important to inform the Parliament that after the Fidesz wreckcasting in Szombathely and their candidate for mayor, the notary, life continues. Péter Balázsy, the chief notary of Balázsy County, showed at the very beginning how serious he was about the competition, as he refused to give up his position as chief notary of the county, despite having received several requests to do so. Why this is a problem, I think it's enough to illustrate that as a county chief notary, he is also the chairman of the election committee, so in principle he should be responsible for the cleanliness of the election on which he, as a Fidesz candidate, starts. Despite this, Péter Balázsy kept this position for himself, showing that he does not partly trust his own success and shows how much he does not believe in the independence of the institutions. Péter Balázsy, who is called out of the party and independent by the Fidesz propaganda media, was already in the 17th place of the Fidesz compensation list in 2014, so independent he and his brother Péter Fidelitas in Szombathely is the president of a very important organisation with significant social support. The fact is, however, that Péter Balázsy already made a statement to the Hungarian Nation in his first statement showing how much his policy is in line with the previous ones and how much chaos is on the right side of the wreckage in Szombathely. He said Péter Balázsy: in Szombathely, many large investments have been made in recent years, which are close to 100 billion forints, but I also sense that, in addition to the great improvements, the smaller things that people employ have been less focused. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. [[12.10]] This was said by the candidate for mayor of the political community who gave the city's leadership and the majority until the Tragikomedia of Hendai in the slave law. The thing is, he's talking about the majority of whom he's running for mayor. If there is less attention and resources available to people, it is the responsibility of Csaba Hende, Tivadar Puskás, Lendvai and all the Fidesz representatives, the responsibility of the people who want to lead the team on the next board. In addition, it should be said that ever since András Nemény led Élje Szombathely took over the board's majority, significant resources have been available for road renovations and sidewalks. Every person in Saturday can see the positive effects of this, and yet there is the fact that not admitting what good ideas the opposition had, and how Szombathely Longev is capable of running the city, Péter Balázsy talks nonsense. But I would like to continue: it also says a lot that, while the candidates of Élvi Szombathely have already started the campaign and have already talked to the people of Szombathely about what they would like to do in the next municipality, Fidesz has not yet been able to name their individual candidates. No wonder, because there are many people who have been replaced inside, there are many people who have been involved in scandals in America, when they have been on an official visit, and there have been people who, even though they wanted to run for mayor, Fidesz may not even consider them to be an individual candidate. The fact is that instead of those billionaire investments, Péter Balázsy should talk about his relationship with the political right that threatened the city, for example, by taking the medical emergency on Saturday, when something didn't happen as they wanted it to; what is his relationship with the right on Saturday, which communicates the name of the city with citizens in a way that is embarrassing to the civilian side. This was also said by Péter Balázsy's party partner Tibor Koczka, who is now the reigning deputy mayor. The fact is that Péter Balázsy doesn't talk about sensitive matters, doesn't talk about Progress Stadium, doesn't talk about Zsolt Homlok's gain, doesn't talk about what's going on in Romkert; Péter Balázsy is just decorating, acting as a political paragon in which Csaba Hende's tragic comedy is hidden. Péter Hende Csaba Balázsy's glove puppet is nothing but a glove puppet with a nice smile who serves to make people believe that Fidesz is not what he really is. At the same time, I trust that in October the people of Szombathely will see through this, they will choose András Nemény and Szombathely Long live, and finally Szombathely, worthy of his old reputation, will be fine, and finally András Nemény will be the mayor who will restore the city's old honor. Thank you very much.
u2019-07-12-54	Dear Parliament, Mr Dániel Z. Kárpát, Jobbik Group has applied for a post-meeting speech. It's an address. I give you the floor.
u2019-07-12-55	Mr President, Dear House, In closing the half-season in Parliament, we have to be sad that, although there was no shortage of production reports or verbal rhetorical struggles about fiscal barcodes, the issues of fate affecting the real Hungarian madness simply ran past the Hungarian Parliament; I wish to change this somewhat with my modest means. Thousands of families were torn apart in Hungary during the period called the Year of Families, before and after. How much longer? In my series, "According to the reality, I bring to Parliament concrete life stories of Hungarian families. Obviously, the historical responsibility is no longer mine, if there is a meaningful answer to this, there is no meaningful answer to these stories now, but someday the historical justice will surely come. The latest story I brought here is quite shocking compared to the usual one, since a family that took a total loan of HUF 4.5 million in 2007 would have been evicted in the capital one day before the graduation of the child, in the possession of a property that was later taken to approximately HUF 30 million at the time of the auction. The loan of 4.5 million was taken into account for 20 years, initially for HUF 44 800 per month. Inexplicably, however, the creditor bank began to give and buy this debt as a fish scotch, and began to ring it on the market, and thus, going to the first and then to the second company, and then to a debt manager, it began to swell and multiply, while the family concerned paid the required amount each month. So there would have been no legal basis for the financial institution and its accomplices to act as a fish scotch, of course, in quotes, and to make this claim among themselves. We also have to say that the creditor bank concerned has not explained since then, and has not provided any official explanation as to how it might have occurred that they started to pay or pay the debt which they had paid continuously, and for which there was a continuous repayment even when the repayment almost doubled. In 2017, the family was executed by paying HUF 7.4 million for the much lower amount of the claim, but they still owed HUF 6.5 million on paper. At the same time, they received a generous offer from the creditor: if within a year they pay the remaining debt of several million HUF, they can leave as a free man. At this point, they should have paid more than three times what they recorded. As they did not agree to this incredibly impertinent offer, of course there was an auction, and in 2018 they auctioned off the property that, even though it was worth 30 million, started from 16 million. It stopped at 20.8 million in Mónika's case, and the executive then came to them with a total of HUF 11 million, which is what he wanted to provide to the family after the family's home. We also have to think it amazing that the eviction date was set for the next strike on June 13 this year. So we're talking about a story of a thousand wounds, legal anomalies that couldn't happen in a rule of law. I would also like to say that when the family asked for help, and did so through social media, they also made an obvious appeal to the pro-government representatives, who had all the powers, all the means to help. Finally, Jobbik's lawyer and Jobbik's expert came in contact with this family, trying to help them, the result of which was that the family received a reprieve after a very high-quality defence submission. First, the eviction date was cancelled, and then another round of negotiations is expected, where this family can win the right one, who buys time, gain life on a basis. I am extremely proud of the colleagues who participated in this work, they helped this Hungarian family, and if the circumstances go well, they saved it. At the same time, I would like to say that this would not be the task of opposition representatives, parties, activists, free lawyers working beyond their working hours, but indeed of a decent government, which in the year of the families, during this period, should be mandatory in order to ensure that sharks and hyenas are not able to hunt smoothly in confusion. I would also like to say that this would be the case, this settlement would happen if this government did not treat these citizens as barcodes, but saw real people, human fates and tragedies behind them, and noticed them. And if you interfere, you can be sure that you can count on my vote as well. Thank you for your attention. [[Let's hear it for Jobbik.]]
u2019-07-12-56	Thank you, Congressman. Dear Parliament, After the agenda, Mr Ander Balázs, Jobbik Group, spoke with the title "Destroying countryside, dying villages". You have the floor, Congressman.
u2019-07-12-57	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, Decades ago, death knocked on the south side of Somogy County, and since then, the Reaper has reaped abundantly. When, through my own constituency, I am talking about the destruction of the countryside by presenting the examples of South and Internal Somogy, I would also like to say that I would also like to talk about the decline of the Cherehát or the actually irresistibly sunk Ormania. This is a cross-system problem. I do not wish to impose absolute responsibility on any government here because of what we see there, in these tiny villages. Let me give you some statistics: I've been doing some research in the last few days, and I've found some amazing numbers. If you look at the population peak, Somogy County has now fallen from its nearly 370 000 level in 1960 to 300,000 people, a decrease of almost 20 percent, and if we go further south, we look at the souther parts, and see that 26 settlements of Barcsi district have lost more than 40 percent of their population. [[12.20]] In the case of the district of Nagyatád, we can talk about a 27 percent decrease in the 18 settlements there. If we look at the case of the district of Csurgo, we can see that the 18 settlements had a 47 percent decrease. From 28,000 people to 15,000 inhabitants. Overall, if you look at these landscapes, these three walks, and the sections of the walk that make up this constituency, it should be said that the population of once almost 120 000 people has now fallen to 70,000 people. So much for keeping the countryside, so much for keeping the population, so much for developing the small-walled areas. I'm telling you, this is a cross-system problem, because the root of this goes somewhere before the war, where the land situation was truly shockingly unfair. I'm telling you, we've been able to copy this by now and create even more unfair land estate conditions. After all, the rule of the great estate is clearly visible, and what is caused by the rule of the great estates there is even more striking out at the fate of these small villages, since deep poverty is concentrated here. Indeed, many of these villages become ethnic, sociocultural detention centres. Gypsyism, the high proportion of Gypsies there, is becoming more marginalized, and the non-Gypsy layers that have sunk have become gypsy in many cases after a while. If there is no effective government assistance coming, and now, when you have accepted here, I am referring to the government colleagues, and, among other things, you have rejected the better proposal to raise the funds for the Hungarian village programme, because if you do not pay more attention to these areas, you will not provide greater support to these declining settlements, then the situation will become irretrievable, and the fallen-walled dust will increase. The amount of money we're talking about? I want to translate it again, to make it more plastic again, what this HUF 90 billion means. In the case of 3 million villagers, this means that 30,000 forints are intended to save the region that forms the backbone of the Hungarian nation. Mr. Oberstromanführer,.Lőrinc Csártárs, earns this much money in 10 seconds, and can increase his wealth by that amount, with which you each wish to support Hungarian survival in the rural regions. Dear Lords of the Government! Wives with eyes! As a member of the rural parliament, I am ashamed that the amendment in which we could have thrown a lifeline for declining areas such as the internal and South Somogy region, which is still affected by enormous unemployment, has not been accepted. I wish you to open your ears more in the future and hear the complaints of these areas, even if it is translated to you by opposition representatives. Thank you for your attention. [[Applause in the benches of Jobbik.]]
u2019-07-12-58	Dear Parliament, Mr Ádám Steinmetz asked to speak after the agenda with the title of the proposals to solve the problems of the Balatonboglár wine region. You have the floor, Congressman.
u2019-07-12-59	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear Parliament, Ladies and gentlemen, If I had to summarize the most serious problem in Balatonboglár wine region in three words, I would say that the low buying-in prices. In addition, the wine economy in Balatonboglár, commonly known as the lack of processing capacity resulting from the sale of BB and then its dismantling, is flooding the market with cheap wines typically imported from Italy. Many Hungarian producers are unable to sell the fruits of their year-long hard work profitablely. I say this by producing high-quality grapes and wines in the wine region. But let's go in line. Let's look at the Italian wine issue. Only in the first quarter of this year, and now listen very carefully, at an average price of 77 euro cents, we imported nearly 3 million litres of wine from Italy. I understand that the free movement of goods in the European Union is one of the basic principles, but yet, for us, for example, selling current wine in neighbouring Austria is an almost impossible category. Therefore, it is time for the government to finally take action against the import of liquids that can only be termed wine with goodwill. I go further: the Hungarian Tourism Agency for the promotion of Hungarian wines can only spend 150 million HUF per year on public wine marketing. According to one of the agency's managers, this amount would require at least ten times the amount needed for meaningful work. And last but not least, the question of BB. The privatization of the winery and its demise made the lives of 1,600 families miserable. Of course, you can blame Tamás Suchman, ex-minister, who played BB for tobacco in the 1990s. Yet I am turning to my fellow members of the Government, and I ask the question: why did you not like to buy me back? You've been ruling for nine years! Yet József Attila Móring, your representative, proposed from the opposition ten years ago that BB should be bought back. Interestingly, the Deputy State Secretary of the Agricultural Ministry does not know about this and he said that this issue is not on the agenda. For this reason, I put it in for next year's budget as an amending proposal to provide funding for BB's buy-back, and it is now also a realistic opportunity, since an area of 8 hectares of the plant is for sale. However, I was shocked to note that this proposal was rejected by you and personally by Attila Moring József. I would like to draw attention to the fact that BB is not only needed in the wine region because of nostalgia and the glorious past. 70 percent of the grapes produced on 3200 hectares leave the wine region unprocessed. The benefits resulting from the processing and the income derived from it thus do not enrich the producers. And if you don't want to buy BB back, here's another solution. Let's build a new vineyard and fruit processing plant and put it in the hands of local producer groups, which wouldn't cost a stadium. In addition to local vineyards and winemakers, Sándor Gombos himself, President of the Chamber of Agriculture of Somogy County, supports this idea, and has long proposed Ottó Légli, President of the National Council of the Mountains. Shockingly, doesn't the Ministry of Agriculture know about this either? Ladies and gentlemen, Let's find a solution to the problems of the Balatonboglár wine region together! Let us do everything we can to ensure that the buying-in price of grapes is rising, not the price of gas oil and pesticides. To this end, let us help the market access of our excellent wines with effective wine marketing! Let's go to our country against cheap Italian mass wines at 70-150 HUF/litre! Set up a modern vineyard and fruit processing plant in the wine region! I trust your cooperation. Thank you for listening. [[Applause in the benches of Jobbik.]]
u2019-07-12-60	Thank you, Congressman. Dear Parliament, After the agenda, Ms Andrea Varga-Damm, Jobbik Group, spoke with a title to the memory of our teacher János Szigeti Tóth. You have the floor, Congresswoman.
u2019-07-12-61	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear House, Ladies and gentlemen, You're saying he's a folk teacher? I say János Szigeti Tóth. You're saying it's perseverance? I say János Szigeti Tóth. On June 25, 2019, our friend János Szigeti Tóth, founder of the Modern Conservative Circle, a great warrior of folk culture, folk education and culture gave his soul back to his Creator. He was 72 years old and he was a real leader in the folk college system. He is the leading fighter of lifelong learning and culture, who has been persistently struggling for five decades to create the system of popular colleges that he has dreamed of in Hungary. [[12.30]] Here in the Chamber, I welcome his greatest fellow warrior, his companion, Márta Mihályfi, with whom for several decades they have taken all the means to bring lifelong culture and learning to the conscious development of society and to increase our competitiveness. In Hungarian and international scientific life, the holder of many titles and positions, can hardly be read, described, is such a long way of life, and this career is so rich. At the Janus Pannonius University, at the University of Lajos Kossuth, at the University of St. Stephen, at ELTE teacher, head of department, professor and teacher of excellent professionals for decades. By him, the concept of folk college was first established in Hungary by law. His great pain was that in the field of adult education, cultural organisation as a discipline, there is almost silence in the international field. And at home, the greatest pain was that scientists in this area are characterized by isolation. However, the strength and competitiveness of our society could indeed be served by lifelong learning and culture, and all those people who have made a life to achieve results in this area, I also believe that they have not been valued enough. From the summer of 2014, in Mindszentkála, in his garden, he created once a year the end-of-summer program entitled Conversation under the walnut tree. The sixth one was prepared for this kind of conversation. Unfortunately, he couldn't have lived through this, but I think, and I hope that last Friday, at the funeral I met, he and his fellow fighters will continue this conversation in memory of him. The aim of these discussions was to work together with fellow scientists and renowned public figures to find answers to questions that characterize Hungarian society, today's Hungarian society and public life, to find answers to this somewhat distorted social and economic relationship. How to preserve, create and lead Hungarian society to the creation of the need for learning and culture in such a distorted and troubled world. But you can't just talk about it as a scientist. I'd like to say a few words about the man whose smile was untraceable. As a man, he had a smile full of love and affection, a radiant personality rarely found among men. His humanity and the goal he has maintained for a lifetime can be an example for all of us if we just hold on to his smile, his activity, his memory, and we can't do our job badly. In his inscription it was, "I fought through the good fight, I finished my career, kept my faith, and I was ready for the wreath of truth." Thank you.
u2019-07-12-62	Thank you very much, Congresswoman. Thank you for giving the memorable speech for all of us. I knew him myself. Thank you. Dear Parliament, After the agenda, MEP Lajos Rig, Jobbik Group, asked for a speech on the title "Greeting Germany." You have the floor, Congressman.
u2019-07-12-63	Thank you very much for the floor. Mr President, It is very difficult to find words after such a speech, for I personally knew John. He was a very good man, a very good expert and an infinite good man. God rest his soul. On Monday, I thanked Switzerland and the donors here in Parliament, who have already helped Hungary and the Hungarian institutions on several occasions. Now, continuing this line, although a little chronologically interrupted, since several cities of both Tapolca and Hungary have received donations from Germany since 2015. If we go through one or two public institutions in Hungary and get a look at the state in which these institutions suffer, we look at, say, the furniture of a school, we look at, say, the equipment and equipment of a health institution, well, critical sounds are heard from these institutions. In recent years, we have received such donations from Regensburg many times and many times, and allow some institutions to be listed without the need for completeness. In particular, the municipality of Tapolca has received office supplies on several occasions, the Batsányi János primary school benches, chairs, the Tapolca hospital's medical equipment, beds, the lips hospital's disposable equipment, beds worth millions of forints, the home of the elderly in Tapolca, the home of the old people in Mindszentkálla are all electric beds, as well as the home of the elderly. In Regensburg, there are two gentlemen who spend their days in the Health Council, and their willingness to help is inexhaustible, and they will still receive supplies from them today. This speech is for them and for them. I would also like to thank you for your unselfish help. One gentleman's name is Josef Troidl, the other is Rudolf Eberwein. Both in Regensburg are old founding members of the CSU faction. I would like to thank them again from here, and it is not enough to connect to Regensburg, and we need a link in Hungary that connects these two strands, and that is László Sándor, the notary of the IPA organization. He's arrived and he's gonna arrive several times, a shipment like this. I call from Parliament on the leaders of the institutions to do not fear, to find us, we will help them, because we know that it is very difficult to replace these office equipment or classroom equipment on our own, so that we can help them. Thank you again, Regensburg and Germany. [[A round of applause from Jobbik.]]
u2019-07-12-64	Thank you very much, Congressman. Dear Parliament, After the agenda, Mr Tibor Nunkovics, Member of the Jobbik Group, applied for a post- Agenda address:. When does the Government pay attention to the real problems? It's an address. You have the floor, Congressman.
u2019-07-12-65	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, First of all, allow me to say what an honor it is for me to be here today and to speak within the walls of this House in the interests of the people. I'm less happy to look at the benches across the street and see a total of two pro-government representatives, and the others must have something more important to do. I have been thinking for a long time about what the subject of my sermon should be, until finally I have come to the conclusion that I would like to say here, within the walls of Parliament, the problems that are seriously affecting our region and which were also in my programme, and therefore I feel obliged to talk about these serious problems within the walls of Parliament. One of these is the issue of Highway 10, which is becoming more and more urgent for people living along the main road and in its immediate surroundings, as this main road is now trafficing like a small highway and is already exceeding this traffic in certain parts of the day. Recently, civil society organisations also collected signatures and discussed with the competent ministry on the question of when the M10 bypass road could finally be built, but to date they have not received any specific answers, and believe me, those who live there, or use this route every day, to go to Budapest, say, to work or to school, are becoming more and more bitter about their everyday life by the absence of this journey. [[12.40]] Another issue is the issue of health, although this could be a national issue, and unfortunately it could be today, but in our area, the government has managed to address this by bringing together the health institutions of Dorogi and Esztergom, which was expected to solve the shortage of doctors, the potential disruption of care. To date, this has not been successful, although the fact is that there are minor advances, but this sector is also characterised by the fact that there is a lack of specialist orders and a growing shortage of doctors here. As much as hospital managers and health workers struggle, the government must finally recognise that the health sector is not a business from which the state can obtain money. It is a service for which people, taxpayers, pay very serious money, and the state should therefore provide something. The third is a very important topic, which could be national, but it also affects our area more negatively because it is an industrialized area with many multinational companies, and it is the issue of wages that is increasingly burning, and unfortunately we also experience on our own skin who, as a factory worker, has worked for ten years, is that there is a very big gap in this issue. Jobbik came up with a proposal from the Wage Union a few years ago, which you have commented that we want to put in Brussels' hands various tax jurisdictions, which is a blama and a huge bullshit. Our goal is to finally start catching up on Hungarian wages to European standards, not to break them down. There is nothing better to show this than that the Hungarian average wage represented one third of the average German wage at the time of accession, while, unfortunately, it is only a quarter or a fifth today, despite the government's communication about the rise in wages, unfortunately these are not substantial wage increases. Unfortunately, the Hungarian people are already working themselves to death, and this is increasingly literally understood. And then there comes a guy like Lajos Kósa, who, in December last year, submitted a terrible legislative amendment proposal in which he pushed the working time limit, and thanks to Parliament, he voted for two thirds of the Fidesz. So there's a Lajos Kósa, who probably hasn't worked hard for a minute in his life, since 1990 a Member of Parliament, has no idea [[Balázs Győrffy intervenes.]] Thank you for what Hungarian people need, and present such a proposal. My fellow members of the Government. Hungarian people do not need more work, because, as I said, they are already working themselves to death, but they need a decent wage for their decent work, and that is really dangerous, you know, my fellow Member. Thank you so much for listening. [[Let's hear it for Jobbik.]]
u2019-07-12-66	Thank you. Dear Parliament, After the agenda, MEP Zoltán Balczó from the Jobbik Group asked for a speech on the election of the President of the European Commission. My dear fellow Member, you have the floor.
u2019-07-12-67	Mr President, thank you for the floor. As is well known, the European Council has proposed Ursula von der Leyen, Germany's current Minister of Defence, to the new President of the European Commission. In this connection, we Hungarians rightly ask why Viktor Orbán supported a candidate, and even lobbyed for him, who seeks to eliminate the nation states and is pro-migration. Perhaps I do not need to stress how important it is for the future of the European Union to see what views the future Commission President has on the most important issues. Orbán made it clear that his Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government's competent spokesperson confirmed that he would only support a candidate who would take action against migration and respect the Member States. Well, Ursula von der Leyen is certainly not anti-migration. Hungary was attacked sharply at the time when Hungary defended its borders and the Schengen borders against the migrant flood and introduced refugees with its family into its house. This latter act is, of course, personally humane, a humanitarian act, but as a German minister it is nothing more than the expression of the State's Willkommenskultur: encouraging those who wish to emigrate. It is also well known that it is a fan of the European United States. He is also a member of the Advisory Board of the Munich Security Conference, together with György Soros. So if I were to use Fidesz's usual stigmatizing categorization, I would have to say that George Soros's man, he's pro-immigrant, and he's trying to eliminate the nation states. Then let's ask ourselves, why did our prime minister support a candidate who doesn't meet the requirements of him in any way? The answer isn't in principle, it's not in the ideological dimension, it's in person. With the support of Ursula von der Leyen, he was able to succeed in his personal struggle against Manfred Weber, preventing the European People's Party's top candidate from becoming Commission President. To this end, the Visegrád Four joined forces with Emmanuel Macron, for whom the Hungarian Prime Minister embodies all that he wants to fight. He put it this way: "Choose my Europe, not Orbán's! So this is the great diplomatic success of the Visegrád Four? On Monday, we heard about this from the pro-government speakers. What's the success? Manfred Weber instead of Ursula von der Leyen? From the cob to the bucket. Orbán has a growing personal ambition to be seen as Europe's dominant prime minister, but this cannot be achieved in personal matters, with machiavellistic actions, even if they are successful. To do so, we should restore the rule of law at home, put an end to the exercise of power based on the feudal chain, the maintenance of existential fear, the incitement of hatred, the service of cheap and deprived workers of the rights of international investors. Resources should be invested in education and training, with the European Public Prosecutor's Office's control of the use of EU funds, constantly supporting small and medium-sized enterprises with high added value, reducing fragmentation through a solidarity social policy, thus keeping young people at home, creating a real hope for everyone in a growing country. The Prime Minister of Hungary, presenting such results, would have great authority and appreciation on the European Union scene. Unfortunately, the fulfillment of these can't be imagined of Viktor Orbán. Thank you very much. [[Let's hear it for Jobbik.]]
u2019-07-12-68	Thank you. Dear Parliament, Member Tamás Pintér of the Jobbik Group has applied for a post-meeting speech:. Shall we sell the city? It's an address. You have the floor.
u2019-07-12-69	Thank you very much for the floor. Mr President, Dear House, In order for you to have nothing left to do with this, a Fidesz from Újpest said when he was asked why to steal so brazenly and transparently. But Gábor Cserna, the Fidesz mayor of Dunaújváros, could have said that, when we asked him several times why he had to take a loan of HUF 1.5 billion at the expense of the city so that you wouldn't have anything left. The outgoing mayor sees only one chance to stay in his seat in October, namely to receive and spend this 1.5 billion HUF loan during the campaign period. But the mayor doesn't know that the Dunaújváros are not stupid, and no matter how much the mayor can spend, they won't vote for him again. That's why I'm telling him from here not to spend the money the city hasn't yet received, because if I catch him on cheating or sloppy treatment, or criminal activity, he might as well go to jail from October. [[12.50]] I would also remind the government that last time they replied that the borrowing request had not yet been submitted to them, but that they could not allow borrowing for operation, for which the municipality had requested the money, anyway. To the best of my knowledge, the loan still hasn't come to the municipality, while the Fidesz city administration is pretending to receive this money, and it doesn't matter whether it will or not, it will be spent generously from this year's budget, the city's money. Translated into Hungarian: it doesn't matter whether the government authorizes the loan or not. If allowed, even years later Dunaújváros will moan about the details of the debt, when Gábor Cserna will be a bad memory for all of us, if not allowed, and the city will go bankrupt again this year. Among other things, this is the irresponsible management and behaviour that makes Gábor Cserna and his team have to leave town as soon as possible. You know, fellow Members, I love this city. I like the people there, I like the roads, I like the iron works, I like the atmosphere that surrounds us in general. That is why I began to politicalize; because I feared the city of those who, not with love like me, thought of the people who lived there for profit and lived on them. When I'm at home, I'm neither a Jobbik nor a Opposition, I'm from Dunaújváros, and in this capacity I'm going to be tested against Fidesz's policy. Now in front of you, in the temple of the nation, I promise you: I will never allow anyone to destroy my beloved city. Thank you for listening. [[A round of applause from Jobbik's benches.]]
u2019-07-12-70	Thank you. Dear Parliament, After the agenda, Mrs Dóra Dúró, an independent Member, asked for more decisive action in national policy with the title of Mi Hazank. I give you the floor, Congresswoman.
u2019-07-12-71	Thank you for the floor. Mr President, Dear Parliament, By protesting before the Romanian embassy, the Sixty-four Vármegye Youth Movement also expressed its expectation that more decisive action was needed in national policy nearly a hundred years after the entry into force of the Trianon peace dictatorship. In the framework of this action, Gábor Barcsa-Turner, the head of the Sixty-four Vármegye, managed to get into the State Department building in person, where we managed to pass our petition on to the Ministry's staff. Therefore, they should be thanked, and we hope that the Ministry's staff will also make efforts to implement this petition, as well as Minister Péter Szijjártó himself. The lessons learned from the case in Susvölgy also highlight the need for this more decisive action, taking into account national aspects, and that is why we have asked the Ministry to pay particular attention to what is contained in the petition. At the same time, we must express our disappointment because the patriotism of Fidesz had no longer spread to support, for example, the proposal for a budget amendment to the central budget for 2020 that we should build a Catholic chapel for the cemetery in Uzhvölgy in order to prevent the Romanian conquest that will take place in the construction of an Orthodox church, as it was initiated there by a Romanian MEP and several Orthodox high priests. We must also make it clear to the Romanians that the cemetery of Uzvölgy is part of the Hungarian national heritage, where in the vast majority Hungarian soldiers rest, and whatever they do, whatever they build, it remains so, this cemetery will never belong to the Romanians, it is a memorial place for the Hungarians. In 12 points in the petition, the Sixty-four Várgye Youth Movement summarized the most pressing, urgent and important national political demands, the implementation of which will no longer be postponed, and I would like to present this in the Parliament. On the one hand, István Beke and Zoltán Szőcs, who are also members of the Sixty-fourth Vármegye Youth Movement, should ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pardon the Romanian head of state and, on the other hand, the Hungarian military cemetery in Uzvölgy must be restored in its original state by the Hungarian State and the Hungarian State to resolve this issue peacefully. The amazing pökhendic attitude of the Romanian ambassador in Budapest, which has been embodied in his scandalous and unacceptable absence, should clearly bring with him the idea of banning him from Hungary, and this will also send a clear and definite message to the Romanians that this attitude will not lead to any good. The Sixty-four Vármegye also demands that Hungary examines Romania's participation and involvement at the state level at international level in the case of the military cemetery in Uzvölgy, as there are very serious opportunities in this regard as well. Not only should the Romanian ambassador in Budapest be banned, but also the anti-Hungarian souvinist blogger Dan Tanasă who constantly reveals himself in public life that he seeks to remove Hungarian symbols and inscriptions and their legitimate use in an offensive way. One of the demands of the Sixty-four Vármegye is that Hungary terminates the bilateral military tomb agreement with Romania, and in several ways draws the international public's attention to Romania's anti-Hungarian and chauvinist policies at the expense of Hungarians. The Hungarian Government is also asked to publish the list of Hungarian citizens banned from the territory of neighbouring states, to guarantee the Hungarian language education in all trianon successor states, and to persuade Slovakia to abolish the law that withdraws Slovak citizenship from all those who take up other citizenship. Slovakia should also eliminate the legacy of Beneš Decrees in breach of international law and effectively combat the forced recruitment of Hungarian citizens in Transcarpathia, for example by not supporting Ukraine's accession to the European Union. Last but not least, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Trianon peace dictatorship, it is particularly topical to combat the territorial autonomy of national communities. We call on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take a firm action in the field of national policy. Thank you for your attention. [[A round of applause from Jobbik's benches.]]
u2019-07-12-72	Thank you, Congresswoman. Dear Parliament, Mr István Apáti, an independent Member, also came forward after the agenda, with the title of the forgotten statesman. I'll give the floor to Congressman.
u2019-07-12-73	Thank you for the floor, Mr President. My fellow Members, who are still here, are still here. Dear Parliament, On June 15, 2019, the Mi Hazank Movement and the Independent Little Farmers' Party remembered one month ago in a small village in Baranya County, Bissén, one of the finest Hungarian statesmen, the native of the village, the late Prime Minister Ferenc Nagy. Ferenc Nagy's late Prime Minister's career is abundant in extraordinary twists, events that fit American adventure, history and spy films, but allow me to present only a few important stages, some important images of this career, due to the shortness of time, bringing it to the House and presenting the astonishing historical and political failure, which, by the way, is crucially the responsibility of the last thirty years. Ferenc Nagy was born in 1903 in Bissé, Baranya county, and was ten years old when he got to know all the troubles of hard farming, since his father was taken to the front. At the age of 19, he gave a speech in memory of the heroes of the First World War of Bisse, about which his talent was noticed, actually dated from here, where his political career began, which took on a lightning start, as he was already the national party secretary at the age of 27. Then, toward the end of World War II, a series of tragic events led to the death of his mother, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, in connection with which he experienced the extraordinary vileness of both destructive world orders, the vileness of the world order that hated on an ethnic, racial, religious basis, and the vileness of the world order that aroused hatred on a class-based basis. He was a prisoner of the Gestapo for six months from April 1944. His eldest son was held in a youth detention camp for a long time, and then his mother's tragic death on 14 September 1945, which is the sin of shameful behavior, the ignominious conduct of Russian soldiers. [[13.00]] His mother didn't want to give the family's chariot and the family's two horses to the Russians, after which the Russians followed him in a tank, the tank ran over the cart, his mother was swept down by the tank's barrel, and he died. 1945, however, was not only memorable of this family tragedy, but also of a bright political success, when the Kis Farmer Party achieved 57 percent, 57 percent, my fellow Members, in the parliamentary elections at that time, but the Soviet troops and the occupying Soviet troops were already in Hungary, so there was practically no other chance than to enter a forced coalition, although there was no need and no reason to do so. Ferenc Nagy became Prime Minister of this country on February 4, 1946. He has been in this position for only 16 months, but I can assure you that during that 16 months he has done more for this country than others have done for 16 years. Without the need for completeness, I would highlight three moments, not reducing its merits, just by mentioning in parentheses that he also had a Minister for Reconstruction in front of the Prime Minister of this country: he has implemented a land reform, he has curbed hyperinflationary, and very few people know that he has introduced the forint. It is thanks to him and his government that the Hungarian forint is still the official currency of this country. At the same time, he was a victim of the communist scheme, and in a manner appropriate to spy films, on the Austrian-Swiss border, on a bridge, on the engine roof of a car, on a hotel letter of resignation, and his youngest son, who was practically taken hostage, was not released until he had resigned from the post of Prime Minister in these circumstances. This was the last moment that he stayed in Hungary for the previous few days, he could never come back to his beloved country again. In 1956, during the revolution and the war of freedom, the Austrians, referring to their neutrality, were not allowed into the territory of the country. After that, from 1956 until his death in 1979, he tried to do everything he could for Hungarian freedom, trying to help the small farmer society. He was constantly writing with a colleague of a former farmer, and in the last years of his life he worked to bring the Saint Crown and the crown jewels home to Hungary, but unfortunately he could not have been worth it. Far from his beloved homeland, he's buried in a small town near Washington, in the town of Herndon. This is why the Hungarian Movement, together with the Kisgazda Party, demands that the birthplace of Bisse be declared a memorial house, erect a statue in memory of the late Prime Minister, take its place in history education, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs take all necessary measures to contact relatives in the United States and to keep in regular contact with them. Thank you very much for your attention. [[Let's hear it for Jobbik.]]
u2019-07-12-74	Thank you, Congressman. Dear Parliament, We have reached the end of the speeches after the agenda. I would like to inform you that you will be informed of the date of the next Parliament meeting. Thank you for your work. I wish you a rest and a pleasant holiday. Goodbye. The meeting's closed.
