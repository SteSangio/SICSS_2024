u2020-07-03-1	Dear Parliament, Mr President, On 29 June 2020, the Speaker of Parliament sent a single bill containing the transposition of the amendments adopted by the Parliament on Hungary's central budget for 2021, requesting the Stability Act 25. According to Article 44 of the Law, its opinion on compliance with the sovereign debt rule and the prior consent of the Fundamental Law pursuant to Article 44 (3) to the final vote on the bill. On the basis of its examination, the Council took the following decision at its meeting on 1 July 2020. It concluded that the additional expenditure appropriations proposed for adoption in the draft budget law were fully supported in part by additional revenue appropriations, part by redeployment of expenditure and reserve appropriations. Thus, the amount of cash flow deficit and government debt does not change, nor does the result-based deficit go away. As a result, we still considered the government debt ratio planned for 31 December 2021 to be sound T/10710/839 on Hungary's central budget for 2021. Proposal for a Single Budget Act No 3 § 1 as planned. We believe that it has been established in accordance with the provisions of the Stability Act and is in line with the macroeconomic and public finances processes on which the bill is based. Since the value of the sovereign debt indicator, calculated by the end of 2021, is 3.3 percentage points lower than the expected value of the indicator by the end of 2020, the requirement of Article 36 (5) of the Fundamental Law is also met. On this basis, the Board granted its prior consent pursuant to Article 44 (3) of the Fundamental Law in accordance with Article T/10710/839. The final vote on the single budget bill. Dear Parliament, Please allow me, in accordance with the mandate of the Council, to give very brief reasons for its decision. The framework of the sovereign debt rule is defined by the Fundamental Law as follows: . As long as the government debt exceeds half of the total domestic product, Parliament may only adopt a central budget law containing a reduction in the ratio of the government debt to the total domestic total product. The bill fully complies with this rule. The Stability Act also provides for a requirement for the development of debt, according to which the sovereign debt ratio should be reduced by at least 0,1 percentage points. The single bill shows that the debt indicator could be reduced to a much greater and better direction next year. Dear Members, Ladies and Gentlemen, In the process of the Council, he followed the parliamentary discussion of the draft budget law. On the basis of a review of the proposal for a single budget law, it concluded that the changes in appropriations to be adopted by Parliament compared to the bill submitted raise the expenditure total by around HUF 92 billion. Individual expenditure appropriations will increase by some HUF 214 billion, the source of which is largely provided by internal expenditure and reserve transfers and, to a lesser extent, by additional revenue appropriations. In particular, the specific tax forecast of small taxpayers will be increased by HUF 40 billion, while the budget of the general sales tax will be increased by HUF 33 billion. The change in tax appropriations is justified by the increase in budget expenditure, but its feasibility carries a risk, as is the increase in certain appropriations opened from above and the reduction of others. The reduction in the amount of security reserves also reduces the scope for managing budgetary risks. In addition to making these awareness-raising comments, the Council concluded that T/10710/839 The Council did not require the provisions of the Single Budget Act No 3/2020.05.21. In its opinion No 3 on the revision of the assessment of the application of the sovereign debt rule. The Council considers that the risks to the achievement of the deficit target may be a worse economic situation as a result of the reflame of the coronal virus epidemic, with a significant number of crisis management expenditures affecting the expected development of public debt. Therefore, in order to maintain sound public finances, the Council considers it important to ensure consistent implementation of forward-looking and responsible budgetary practices, as has been the case so far, in 2021. In conclusion, I would like to say to you, on behalf of the Council, that, although the risks are greater than in previous years, they are manageable. The opportunities created by the budget, if we make use of them, can open up new modernisation pathways in public finances, so there is hope for better scenarios. Thank you for your kind attention. [[Applause in the ranks of the ruling parties.]]

u2020-07-03-7	I was on a surreal time travel when I visited Chenya. This is the settlement where even the ambulances in January dared not enter when they were alerted to a man in a life-threatening condition. But not only did they not dare to go out to the patient themselves, but even after the arrival of the policemen they did not dare to enter the settlement. It makes me wonder that there are complete settlements in Hungary where public workers, if they are called, do not dare simply enter, even with police escorts. Of course, I went in after that, and I saw amazing pictures, and I was faced with shocking conditions. The reason the paramedics didn't go to the scene is because they were threatened with death by the phone call. Nevertheless, they arrived at the border of the settlement, which in itself shows an extremely serious professional commitment, for which they deserve to be thanked. Instead, what happens in Hungary? Not only does the state not express its gratitude, but it initiates proceedings, the police report them, imprison them for reckless endangerment in their work against people who, following a death threat, go out to the patient whose family or acquaintances were exposed to this death threat. Plus, they've been kidnapped. I also visited the rescue station where they do their daily work. The workers there also told us that the life of the entire rescue station is still determined by this case, that every day they talk about the situation of their troubled comrades. On the other hand, we have offered legal help to these troubled paramedics, and we would like to declare that we are doing everything in our power to enforce their truth. Because, in fact, they are right in this situation, and the result of the world being turned upside down is that they are still the ones who are being held prisoner and who are being prosecuted in this matter. But Chenyéte is not only interesting because of what happened in this settlement in January, because if you go in, it will be in a completely different world. Even in the most liberal newspapers, we have read reports about this village that even liberal journalists have not dared to enter the settlement, only accompanied by the mayor, and indeed, if you are there, you will realize that the rules, the standards on which we live here or which are valid throughout Hungary, are simply out of word in this settlement. When you arrive at Chenet, you see that the weeds have reached your neck, the plaster is falling off the houses, some of them have no roof, and I say quite frankly that I have never been to a settlement like this, because I have not seen any house that could be regarded as a normal house, all the buildings of the settlement are in ruins. On the streets you meet not only stray dogs, but also stray children: three-four-five-year-old children expelled to the streets, without parental supervision, walking around in dirty, incomplete clothing, hanging around, doing nothing. People go there with cars that obviously don't meet the standards that a car should meet: they create these wreckage without a license plate, made of several cars, which you don't actually see in a junk derby. In these cars, eight or ten people travel at once, totally happy, breaking all kinds of regulations. You're faced with terrible, catastrophic conditions. And what is most terrible, honourable fellow Members, is that the mayor himself told the Informant's camera that the police really can't control the people who live there, and that he is the only one who can influence them, so that they don't respond to the calls of the police. I very much hope that this surreal time travel is only Hungary's past and not its future. Thank you very much for your attention. [[A round of applause from Jobbik.]]
u2020-07-03-8	Thank you very much, Congresswoman. After the agenda, Mr Ádám Steinmetz from the Jobbik Group applied for a speech. Here you go, Congressman. You have the floor.
u2020-07-03-9	Thank you very much for the floor, Mr President. Dear Parliament, The events of the past few months have moved many families into uncertainty. Many of our countrymen's daily livelihoods have been lost or decreased drastically, overnight. According to KSH data, the number of people employed in the workplace decreased by 200,000 compared to last year. According to the National Employment Service, there are 363 thousand registered job seekers in Hungary. Meanwhile, the Fidesz government did not spend almost anything to protect jobs in proportion to its GDP during the crisis. The latter is claimed by the Hungarian National Bank. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm from Somogyország, which last year was 15th in county average earnings. A lot of people here live on minimum wage and try to support their family out of a hundred thousand forints. But what about those who have lost their minimum income? Just to give you a concrete local example, a German-owned company operating a Marcaliban factory has been divorced from nearly 400 employees since the end of last year. They're taking production to Ukraine. And why do you think that is? Because the high cost of wages doesn't make it worth their while at home. Dear fellow Members, As long as you advertise out of billions to protect the economy, hundreds of thousands of people lose their jobs. Is that what you call a family-friendly policy? You tell the Hungarian people that as many jobs as the virus destroys, we create so much. But what kind of job? Do you really want to go to the people who have just been laid off, including many families with small children, public workers or soldiers? Marcali is a famous military town, but please. Speaking of which, Congressman Attila Móring has promised to become a military plant employing 200-220 people from the vacant marcal barracks, but unfortunately he has not yet managed to achieve this at the government. Well, here you go. Let's do this now. Or anything else that creates meaningful jobs! For example, the buy-back of BB and the creation of a Community vineyard processing plant, or the completion of the MotoGP track in Lanotly, which could really make a living for a lot of people. For this kind of money, public work is not the solution for the 21st century. In the century. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the creation of social well-being must be a joint result of debates on a professional basis. In addition to what has been said so far, we therefore recommend equal pay for equal work in the EU, and that the minimum wage be exempt in Hungary, that men also be able to retire after 40 years of work, and that we create a protection fund, which would provide 80% of the wages lost to those in distress, to which the multinationals and those who have fabulously become rich in recent years have to contribute. These issues need to be discussed as soon as possible, and money is not used for silly propaganda! Dear Parliament, So, at the end of the spring session, I wish you a nice summer, and at the same time I expect all Members, members of the government, ministers and ministers of state to visit us in Somogyország, to see how we live in this wonderful, beautiful corner of the country, where people really love their nation and want to work every day so that their families and this country can rise. Thank you for listening. [[Let's hear it for Jobbik.]] [[12.40]]
u2020-07-03-10	Thank you very much, Congressman. Mr Rig Lajos has also applied for a post-meeting speech from the Jobbik Group. Here you go, Congressman. You have the floor.
u2020-07-03-11	Thank you very much for the floor. Mr President, Ladies and gentlemen, The title of my speech is:,, The margin of a Swiss road 2.0, if I remember correctly, last year I remembered and spoke about a donation from Switzerland. I would like to say a few words and thoughts about a similar donation, but let me explain in a few thoughts before that what experience has been there in the last two weeks, when I have been able to travel to Switzerland twice and talk to the members of the Hungarian community who have been out there for 30 years. Let us first take political culture and compare Switzerland and Hungary. In Switzerland, political culture works by having only political debate during election periods at a civilized debate forum and getting a similar platform for each party, apart from the size of their support in the country. There's culture, there's political culture, there's no filth, there's no character murder. As soon as the election takes place, then the economic stimulus of the country will be put aside. The political culture that has developed in Hungary today, I do not think it is necessary to describe it here, everyone can see it in public media and other television broadcasts. In each of my speeches, I try to make sure that this political public speech, political culture, changes at some level in Hungary. There is a saying that if you have a problem, you can have three types of solution: or you can accept it; if you can't accept it, you will try to change it; if you can't change it, then you will just let it go. About this Swiss donation, I've reached that level, and I'm trying to move on to trying to change it. How can a political culture be changed? Through a donation, I think it may be; and it can also be seen as an exemplary donation, since several parties have taken part in it. In the first round, I would like to thank the donor Swiss party, Andreas Jaross, head of the Order of Knights of Malta in Switzerland, for the opportunity to bring these two trucks to Hungary, and we will be able to hand these equipment over to the Hungarian University of Medicine. I would like to thank Jobbik's party foundation for taking on this considerable amount of transport costs, and it was possible for these instruments to be involved in further medical training. But it is not customary for an opposition representative to thank a minister for his intervention, as we were able to go out to Switzerland at the end of the period when the virus epidemic was already underway in the European Union and Switzerland also opened its borders. And that was Minister Szijjártó and his apparatus. They have been effective in helping us reduce administrative burdens, and allow me to thank Ambassador István Nagy Bernni for his effective intervention, because he has been communicating with us continuously during our stay, and if there were any problems, he has recommended his help. I think that policy can work that way, because this is a step forward in the fact that for a good cause, with a good cause, there are many political parties that can line up. And finally, I would like to thank a Tapolca association, members of the Unity Tapolca Association, for the unselfish work that they did outside Switzerland in loading the goods or in Tapolca, when these two trucks came in, they made an effective contribution. The donation included, among other things, two brain and neurosurgery microscopes that will be handed over to a medical university, which will later, as I have already said, play an important role in further medical training. Thank you once again to everyone involved in this work, and I think and trust that you can change the way you think both here and there, and if I can change the problem, then I will change it, if not, then, as the saying says, I will let you go. Thank you for listening. [[Applause in the benches of Jobbik.]]
u2020-07-03-12	Thank you very much, Congressman. Mr László Keresztes, Head of the Group, applied for a post-meeting speech from the LMP Group. Here you go, Mr. Group Leader. You have the floor.
u2020-07-03-13	Thank you for the floor. Mr President, Dear Parliament, I think it is important to talk about my home, my city, Pécs on the last day of the spring session. The last few months have brought a lot of challenges to the city, and we know that the starting point, even after last year's municipal elections, has been very difficult. The city began its revival with more than 20 billion dollars of debt, its operation after the change of city management, and we can say that in the months that followed, the continued government austerity has made the situation more difficult. To mention a few examples: just taking away the car tax meant cutting Pécs for nearly half a billion dollars and cutting for half a billion. It is also a huge challenge for the government to withdraw from support for local community transport, and this must also be managed by the city. We can also see that unfortunately not only the local government is affected by austerity measures, but obviously also the university, and we know exactly what a huge employment role the university has in addition to its own direct functions is, not only from the point of view of Pécs, but also from the perspective of the whole county and region, and it is clear that the two billion-dollar cuts planned by the government will not be possible for the university to manage, and this will also be a huge economic disaster. There are expected to be very serious cuts. As a Member of Parliament in Pécs myself, I am committed to doing everything I can to withdraw these austerity measures. That's why we work locally and work here in Parliament. I am pleased that the opposition colleagues agree on this, partners, and it is also a very important step forward that local government representatives, i.e. local Fidesz and KDNP municipal representatives, have already figured out how to cooperate for the sake of the city of Pécs, so, unlike the city's pro-government parliamentary representatives, they are already able to act bravely to make positive decisions concerning Pécs and for Pécs. There's good news here in the past few days. It is clear that even from the opposition it is worth working actively in the National Assembly, as we have received a concrete promise that the legislative environment will change, and that biomass-based district heating apartments will be able to apply for a program called "Hot Home" after this change, so people living in district heating apartments in Pécs will be able to apply for various energy upgrades, and this will be a huge step forward in the city's life. We have also received positive feedback that the government is reviewing the problem and recultivation of the Karolina solution for a very long time, and there is a chance that this important work, which, in fact, causes serious environmental risks, can speed up. And there was also a concrete promise from the competent State Secretarys that the elimination of the rubber dump in the neighbourhood of Pécs could be accelerated by a legislative amendment. It is a very difficult situation, but I think it is worth working actively, because it seems that there are positive progresses, and I will continue to work on principles that do not need to represent a party, not to meet a specific ideological and political direction when it comes to representing the interests of a city, a community. I am willing to cooperate along the lines of cases with everyone, and it seems that if there is a broad cooperation that transcends party politics, it is possible to achieve results even from opposition positions. In this session, I worked actively for the city of Pécs, and in this spirit I will continue my work as a representative in the autumn session. Thank you very much.
u2020-07-03-14	Thank you very much, Mr. Group Leader. Dear Parliament, Fellow Members! We have reached the end of the speeches after the agenda.
