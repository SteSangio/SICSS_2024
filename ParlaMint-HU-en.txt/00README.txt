This directory contains the machine translated ParlaMint-HU-en corpus as plain text,
which was automatically coverted from the TEI encoded version of the corpus. The text
files have two TAB-separated columns, the first one giving the ID of the speech,
and the second the plain text of the speech. Transcriber comments are given in
double square brackets.  Additionally, each text file has an associated TSV file
giving the metadata for each speech.
